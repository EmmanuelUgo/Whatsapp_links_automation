# YDP-Whatsapp Resource Link Extractor
>This is a tool that extracts links from WhatsApp.
This folder contains a R script and Python Jupyter Notebook code that reads a WhatsApp chat file, extracts URLs published on the Young Data Professionals' Whatsapp group, and organizes the links into distinct folders. The download of the file is done at a particular set time. The idea for the project emerged from a discussion with other Data Practitioners in the Group.
