12/04/2020, 09:34 - +234 703 461 5552: Halleluyah,

Compliments. 

Love this so I decided to share.

*Jesus* went on a *Self isolation* in the grave for our sins. He was unduly *quarantined* even though He *tested negative* to sin. His Resurrection from His *Isolation Centre* after three days formed the foundation for our release from the *lock down* by sin. Anyone who has been *infected* by *the virus* of sin can be *sanitized* and *recovered* through the *vaccine* of the *Blood of Jesus*. He will subsequently live a Victorious Life through the *Ventilator* of the *Holy Spirit*.

Please *Stay Safe, Be Spiritually Alive & Alert*!!!

*Happy Easter celebration to You and your family.*

12/04/2020, 15:42 - Yusfat: That is, *Gravitation is not responsible for ppl falling in love* - Einstein

12/04/2020, 19:08 - +234 812 216 8133: Hello guys, in cluster analysis, especially Kmeans. It's a good practice to name the clusters/segments. Is there a best way to name them?
Like if Mr Daniel and Judge Analysed the same data, is it possible they come out with the same name for each cluster?
12/04/2020, 19:09 - +234 812 216 8133: Also, to get the optimal number of clusters, would you advise one to first use the dendogram of hierarchical clustering before proceeding to flat clustering eg Kmeans or ignore the former and head straight to the latter?

12/04/2020, 20:11 - +234 703 160 7868: When you say Gigs Are you referring to that in the plural sense? Like more than one?
12/04/2020, 20:18 - +234 816 827 7550: Coask
12/04/2020, 21:05 - +234 816 342 0137: Like anything related to DS that could be offered
12/04/2020, 21:38 - +234 816 342 0137: Does anyone have answer to this?
12/04/2020, 21:44 - +234 817 965 1769: Yes.

I can do free Analysis job during this Isolation and perhaps beyond oo
12/04/2020, 21:45 - +234 703 397 0467: Do you offer such services on online platforms
12/04/2020, 21:58 - +234 812 216 8133: Abeg na, make una no ignore o
12/04/2020, 21:58 - +234 812 216 8133: Edakun
12/04/2020, 22:03 - +234 810 878 6913: Teach me how to go about it, pls
12/04/2020, 22:23 - +234 703 160 7868: ok...since your question bordered on the person who had little knowledge of DS and ML. But to what knowledge you didn't specify. Here is a fact, the truth is you can offer any service at all on a freelancing platform provided the service is being sort for on the platform even without the knowledge, much more when you now have knowledge on it. You can present yourself as a broker (third party) to clients who need any service by securing their jobs and then outsourcing to more proficient guys who know the stuff. 

Firstly, what you need is to make sure you've an established network of proficient people (like 2, 3 or more who are available to pick up your jobs so you can always meetup with the deadlines) who already know it. 

Secondly, know how to negotiate (very essential skill if not the most essential) very well with clients so you can always get the best deals for yourself and the guy who'll eventually execute the task.

Thirdly, create a very good profile (without all the fluffy stuff) on the freelancing platform categorically stating the sort of problems (DS or ML related or anyother area) you can help clients solve and why you should be the go-to person for the solution they are looking for.

Finally, whether you're the one offering the service first hand or via a broker service, just know how to market yourself properly on any of the platforms you may be  seeking your clients from.

12/04/2020, 22:32 - +234 703 160 7868: NB: One of the ways you can use to market your services to easily get clients is to use the free service bait. You know people will always want free things. So just like the old marketing tactic of buy one get one free. You may as well start with offering free service that you know won't be a hassle to you to secure your first set of clients. So even if they're not paying for your service right now, you're guaranteed some good reviews from them as long as you offered them real value service. This in itself will help you get clients via references or even some of the returning clients who'll readily you for the future services you'll offer to them.
12/04/2020, 22:34 - +234 809 479 3406: A portfolio is also important especially when you're writing your cover letter on Upwork
12/04/2020, 22:34 - +234 816 342 0137: And what else can I say?...

Thanks so much. It really helped

I'd do as stated
12/04/2020, 22:37 - +234 703 160 7868: Yes...this is quite important too. But for someone who may just be starting, he may not really have much to show on his portfolio. So doing some free gigs just to build up his portfolio may be the best way to start.

But fortunately for us who want to become DS specialists in different fields, the market is not saturated yet, therefore we can always find ways to continue to position or place ourselves better to fit into the scheme of things. It's all about finding your diffrentiating factor and that time is now though!

13/04/2020, 21:35 - +234 810 878 6913: True, but I would loved to have the experience of the job though as an entry level
13/04/2020, 21:35 - +234 810 878 6913: Mr. Blockchain go n sleep
13/04/2020, 21:35 - Muhammed: Are you a member of Synagogue Church of God?
13/04/2020, 21:36 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm... Okay, I get you Sha, but
13/04/2020, 21:36 - +234 810 878 6913: Not at all
13/04/2020, 21:36 - Muhammed: But what?
13/04/2020, 21:38 - Yusfat: I already have 2 oil n gas job experience... Having more isn't a bad idea, but I knew what I would b missing. Infact, I have stopped applying for any jobs for now... Except its one that goes madly with my spirit (crazy passion), with unique company
13/04/2020, 21:41 - Yusfat: but what oga civil engineering bitcoinaire
13/04/2020, 21:43 - Muhammed: Oil 🛢 and Gas, ẹ̀yán Olamide badoo
13/04/2020, 21:44 - +234 810 878 6913: I think the work experience one will get can't be overemphasized
13/04/2020, 21:45 - +234 810 878 6913: U Dy mind Mr blockchain?
13/04/2020, 21:45 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Oil money 

Show us waynna
13/04/2020, 21:45 - +234 703 344 8466: That is for entry level but as you garner more industry experience working that entry level job. Your levels begin to change
13/04/2020, 21:46 - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly. So somebody like me would loved to have the experience, so I will accept the said Job
13/04/2020, 21:49 - +234 703 344 8466: Exactly but let me tell you something too. As entry level the respect you'd get due to your assumed low value to the organisation would be low. That's why it's not always about the money. Organizational culture too matters. How they treat and develop their workers, job satisfaction etcetera etcetera
13/04/2020, 21:50 - Yusfat: In order to hack my way through, that's why am here😄
13/04/2020, 21:51 - Yusfat: I did my analysis well. I understand ur point.
13/04/2020, 21:52 - +234 810 878 6913: Well noted boss

13/04/2020, 22:00 - Yusfat: Accounting n Auditing aspect, and maybe analytics

I lie?
13/04/2020, 22:02 - Yusfat: U may not b in that department. There is none of Deloitte, PwC and KPMG that doesn't offer services to oil and gas companies, and financial companies

13/04/2020, 22:41 - Yusfat: I didn't some feature engineering yesterday sef

14/04/2020, 13:51 - +234 813 730 6439: Guys,  This table has rows of same names with different values. 

I'm trying to group the rows with same names and also find the total of the values. 

For example :
Tunde | 60
John | 50
Tunde | 30

I want a result such that I will get
Tunde | 90
John | 50

So I tried this on the table I was working on

%sql select distinct(community_area_name), count(college_enrollment) from schools group by community_area_name..

Mind you this gives me results but not the addition of values..  Just the frequency of values attributed to a name. 

I have tried other stuffs anyone that can help me out.. 😢
14/04/2020, 14:00 - +234 816 631 6330: Why not using SUM(college_enrollment)
14/04/2020, 14:01 - +234 813 730 6439: I tried it.. got errors
14/04/2020, 14:04 - +234 813 730 6439: Thanks I have sorted it out

15/04/2020, 08:47 - Olayinka: On Tuesday, 14th April, 2020, fourteen (14) people joined my SQL class on Zoom. I am happy to have taken out time to teach others. 

As requested, I have uploaded the videos for the last class on my google drive. Although, there was a session timed out on #Zoom but we were able to conclude the class. 

You can watch it and download it here: http://shorturl.at/kyzQU

As from next week, we would start practical sessions. We would use #MySQL for the training. 

You can watch this 10 minutes video by Edureka on how to install MySQL on your local machine: https://youtu.be/GIRcpjg-3Eg

Join me again on Saturday (10am GMT +1) on Zoom for another beautiful session: https://zoom.us/j/5280632716

See you in class!

15/04/2020, 11:02 - Yusfat: assumption is not bad na. Mathematics uses too many assumption. W/o it nothing may be possible in or b real in life
15/04/2020, 11:03 - Yusfat: 🙄
15/04/2020, 11:03 - Yusfat: well I support that kinetic motion 🤣
15/04/2020, 11:04 - Yusfat: without mathematical assumptions, financials, forex, stock markets n Bitcoin trading n also engineering etc would be unrealistic.
15/04/2020, 11:09 - Yusfat: .And ur mention of maths and reality reminds me of *albert Einstein's* quote whc says: 

*as far as d laws of mathematics refer 2 reality, they ar nt certain; and as far as they are certain, dey do not refer 2 reality.*
15/04/2020, 11:10 - Yusfat: even w/o assumptions, machine Learning n data science can't come to reality😄😄😄
15/04/2020, 11:10 - Yusfat: bcos statistics is mathematics
15/04/2020, 11:14 - Yusfat: In conclusion, *their assumption that they don't **** men isn't wrong*, it creates open mindedness for them

17/04/2020, 21:49 - +234 806 058 7948: I have a hard time using my website database ...I need to be able to input data for the donor, add new donors, adjust their info but it seems to be really difficult for a non computer person..I mean I created the website but have a hard time with the database..I need a simple concept. My database is egg donors database with basic and full profiles, pictures and search option 

1.Speed of the website
2.Polishing the database to perfection
3.Making sure it's easy to navigate for me as well


Good morning!

There r few issues i have:

1. I understand that there is some kind of back end of the database aka a list of questions where i can input the data AND the official profile where the info is displayed for the ‘users’-people,who will register to the database
However the way it is set up now on that back end is not simple as I have no idea how to input the data in except first few questions here:

2.when u look at the FULL profile of the donor, there r questions and answers to a questionnaire..some responses are next and some below the answers for some reason.
Also there r sum weird long answers or letters as answers.
Also the color of the question and answer should be different so it’s easier for the users to navigate

3.When u look at the BASIC profile,there is a cross in the right upper corner,when u click on it,u go back to the list of profiles...however this feature is missing at the FULL profile.

4.Age of the egg donors: i asked for the feature of the age changing according to changing months/years aka someone was born June 6th,1995 so the age in the profile shows 24 yo..however on June 6th,the age will switch to 25yo without me changing the age manually..i was told that this feature is created but i was never able to confirm that..as I basically dunno where is what created on the backend

5. I also have a search bar created which as of now i dont know if it works..as i need to input more donors there

6. I really would prefer to have an easy to navigate list of questions i can easily input data to,upload images...

Before people will come for my head.
18/04/2020, 09:43 - +234 810 878 6913: How about my SQL
18/04/2020, 09:46 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂🤣🤣
18/04/2020, 09:46 - +234 810 878 6913: How about SQL
18/04/2020, 09:49 - +234 817 965 1769: SQL is structural Query language.


It's a programming language like Python.


It's use for managing database.


It deals with relational Database ie data in a table which consists of rows and columns. Rows are called records and columns are called Fields
18/04/2020, 09:50 - Olayinka: ✅✅✅
18/04/2020, 09:51 - +234 817 965 1769: So to work with SQL, you need some software called relational Database management software like MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Ms server ....


I don't know if my comparison is correct but let me use it for you to understand
18/04/2020, 09:52 - +234 817 965 1769: If you want to work with Python, you can use jupyter notebook or Spyder or Jupyter lab or visual studio or PYCHARM.


Same with SQL.

You can use MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, etc
18/04/2020, 09:52 - +234 817 965 1769: So people prefer MySQL.
18/04/2020, 09:53 - +234 810 878 6913: Oh I get now... Thanks
18/04/2020, 09:53 - +234 810 878 6913: Someone was telling me SQL isn't a programming language
18/04/2020, 09:53 - +234 817 965 1769: The only difference is that: 

The syntax depends on software you are using though with just little difference unlike Python that any thing you use doesn't change the syntax
18/04/2020, 09:54 - Olayinka: ❌❌❌❌❌
18/04/2020, 09:54 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol.... Tell yes.

You should stop arguing with ignorant people
18/04/2020, 09:54 - +234 817 965 1769: Invest the time to learn
18/04/2020, 09:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: SQL is actually not a programming language🥴
18/04/2020, 09:56 - Richie: Programming language 🤨
18/04/2020, 09:56 - +234 817 965 1769: I uploaded covid-19 on my status one day and someday tagged it to say coronavirus is fake.

18/04/2020, 09:56 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's not actually though could try to be when you are doing some advanced stuffs say *Stored Procedures and Cursors* which try to mimic some programming features, so if you aren't doing any of such, well you just querying
18/04/2020, 09:57 - Richie: How can you belittle python ehh
18/04/2020, 09:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 🙈

18/04/2020, 09:57 - +234 817 965 1769: I Know that SQL is just a query language

18/04/2020, 10:00 - Richie: 😂
18/04/2020, 10:00 - +234 817 965 1769: And Python we want to die for self doesn't worth it according to some people.


In fact, they will tell you that it's not a future Programming language

18/04/2020, 10:08 - Tosin Openiyi: Query language vs programming language - all na language na
18/04/2020, 10:08 - +234 817 965 1769: @2348108522573 come and fight Khan academy oooo for saying SQL is a special-purpose Programming language.


They even put special
18/04/2020, 10:08 - +234 817 965 1769: 😂😂😂😂
18/04/2020, 10:08 - +234 703 344 8466: A query language it is then🤔
18/04/2020, 10:08 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol
18/04/2020, 10:09 - Tosin Openiyi: Very special Bro. 🤣
18/04/2020, 10:09 - +234 703 344 8466: Maybe we should do some forecasting to know which languages will be the future🤷🏽‍♂
18/04/2020, 10:11 - +234 817 965 1769: I know it already.


It's JAVASCRIPT 😉😉😉
18/04/2020, 10:11 - Richie: 😂.
As per analyst
18/04/2020, 10:12 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Special purpose for *Querying* 


Other programming language can query too but that's not their core, you want to perform querying and full database management SQL is your go-to 

Why do most/general consider it as not a programming? Because While certain flavours of SQL do allow you to write programs, it is not commonly done. SQL is mostly used for embedding instructions for accessing the database inside of a larger application.


So I wouldn't put SQL in the class of high level languages
18/04/2020, 10:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's obvious you can refute 😀😀😀

That special na him you hold on to?

If we continue drilling the line you sure you can support that special?😀😀
18/04/2020, 10:14 - +234 703 344 8466: True..javascript gives me the chills😫😫
18/04/2020, 10:14 - +234 703 344 8466: 🤣🤣
18/04/2020, 10:15 - +234 817 965 1769: Haha Opiano that serious ooo.

You can go any length to prove that SQL isn't a programming language
18/04/2020, 10:16 - +234 817 965 1769: Just relax.
18/04/2020, 10:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I mentioned Stored Procedures, Cursors & my oga add Triggers too which add that flavor of Programming, but let me ask you?


Have you used any?

If No then SQL to you isn't programming but Querying 

Though those flavors try to embed features of Programming but still they are difficult, I tried running a *cursor* on a large database at work, it took 22hrs 🤦🏿‍♂️ before I embedded Pandas apply function  the thing run in 3hrs.
18/04/2020, 10:16 - Tosin Openiyi: SQL that is doing the dirty backend jobs for you is not a high level language 😳

Baba wetin sql do you o
18/04/2020, 10:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's not any length, it's my opinion😀😀

And what do I know?

I'm not an authority you know
18/04/2020, 10:17 - Richie: What i don't understand is the namw...structure Querying Querying Querying language.. Now Nigerians here want to re write it to Structure Programming Language... Ok.... You won... SPL now.. Not SQL
18/04/2020, 10:17 - +234 817 965 1769: Let me see if I will see a lengthy thesis on the argument.


Any other person can help me
18/04/2020, 10:17 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😀😀😀

SQL no be high level language bro, you fit try check online 😀😀
18/04/2020, 10:18 - +234 817 965 1769: There's a way you can integrate SQL and tableau together.


There's a way too to integrate SQL, Tableau and Python too
18/04/2020, 10:18 - Richie: So💁🏽‍♂️
18/04/2020, 10:18 - +234 817 965 1769: Honestly I don't know. 


As in
18/04/2020, 10:19 - +234 817 965 1769: Meaning that SQL can still enter Programming language categories.


We don't know what SQL do Opiano ooo
18/04/2020, 10:19 - +234 706 942 4890: Anything that can take set of order is tagged to be called program.
SQL can run programs hence it's a programming language. U can say it's not a high level language or an object oriented programming language. It can pass order and get result .  
I think our belittlement of the lanuuage makes us to avoid  the meaning of a programming language
18/04/2020, 10:20 - +234 817 965 1769: Programming language too me is anything that has logic
18/04/2020, 10:20 - +234 817 965 1769: To*
18/04/2020, 10:20 - Muhammed: And semantics àbí 🤣
18/04/2020, 10:21 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No doubt SQL is underated , I get the fact correct 😀, but still SQL no be programming Language na Querying

No mind me just what I think 

I get your point 🤟🏾
18/04/2020, 10:21 - +234 706 942 4890: 🤣
18/04/2020, 10:21 - Richie: And Syntax
18/04/2020, 10:22 - +234 706 942 4890: ✌️
18/04/2020, 10:22 - +234 817 965 1769: 🌚🌚🌚

18/04/2020, 10:22 - Richie: You don't get the gist 😂😂
18/04/2020, 10:23 - +234 803 464 8863: It isn't
18/04/2020, 10:23 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: And I no get beef with SQL

@2348110895622 knows I use it steadily at work because he has saved me countless times when I enter SQL troubles

 Please find below a posting for a remote research fellowship with the UCLA COVID Behind Bars Data Project (www.law.ucla.edu/covidbehindbars). If you could circulate it to current students and recent graduates of your program, I would be grateful. Please encourage potential candidates to apply immediately, as we hope to hire very quickly.
 
 UCLA School of Law seeks to hire two limited-term research fellows for a period of at least six months to staff a new project tracking and analyzing COVID-19 infections and deaths in carceral facilities (prisons, jails, immigration detention centers, and juvenile detention centers). Appropriate candidates will have significant data science experience and skills in Python, R, or a similar language. In particular, they should have proficiency in: (1) scraping and compiling data from a range of web sources, (2) data management and cleaning, (3) statistical methods, and (4) data visualization. Although a relevant degree is desirable, those with demonstrated ability absent a degree should also apply. The ideal candidate will also have interest in and familiarity with the landscape of the criminal legal system, and will be comfortable drafting and coordinating the filing of requests for public records.
 
 These positions will begin immediately and are funded for an initial term of six months of full-time work, with a possible (and potentially part-time) extension, depending on need and funding. The work will be remote (applicants need not reside in California), and will be supervised by Professor Sharon Dolovich, Director of the Prison Law and Policy Program, and Aaron Littman, Binder Clinical Teaching Fellow. The salary will be $55,000 per annum, paid on a monthly basis, with limited benefits including health insurance. To apply, please send a cover letter, resume, and list of references to dolovich@law.ucla.edu and littman@law.ucla.edu. Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis, beginning immediately.

I decided to share this cos it'll limit the burden some people have on buying data, especially during this lockdown

I'm sure some of us here have heard about PalmPay, its similar to the likes of Paga(for transfers, payment of bills, buying airtime and all) so I'll be sharing a link for you register and start enjoying discounts..

Plus you can get bonus for each transaction on the app
It's the best place to buy airtime honestly, cos with Palm points, you can get up to 50% discount on airtime purchase.
24/04/2020, 12:31 - +234 902 233 9854: Oluwajoba invites you to PalmPay, register and login to PalmPay to earn new user rewards https://h5.palmpay.app/#/sign/sign-up?invitQrCode=12OBYA&code=0234&scene=PalmPay&channelName=referrer
24/04/2020, 12:32 - +234 902 233 9854: I don't mind if you don't register, but I can tell you discounts have really helped in these trying times
24/04/2020, 12:33 - +234 902 233 9854: P.S. You have to download the app(13MB) to get started

Help us to understand the pattern and nature of the information that are being shared during this COVID-19 lockdown. We seek your support to share examples of the anonymous messages that you have received or forwarded during this period. 

*How to support the survey*
You will copy examples of COVID19-related anonymous messages from your WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook, email etc. and paste on the survey form. You will also help us with some additional details on your opinion and reaction to these messages. 
Here is a link to the survey: https://bit.ly/COVID19_Infos

24/04/2020, 15:54 - Olayinka: That's not all my Oga oo
24/04/2020, 16:07 - +234 817 965 1769: Is your data on?
24/04/2020, 16:28 - +234 815 308 9036: 😂
24/04/2020, 16:30 - Olayinka: Sure na.. I have solved the issue though
24/04/2020, 16:30 - Olayinka: Or still solving it
24/04/2020, 16:43 - Muhammed: That's from the Anaconda Prompt.

From Jupyter Notebook: !pip install tensorflow

If you're using cmd: conda install tensorflow (also works for Mac and Linux)

For PyCharm and/or VSC: python -m pip install tensorflow.

The choice is yours, happy installation 😊
24/04/2020, 17:04 - Obinna Iheanachor: Use the Anaconda navigator. pip install didn't work for me, this did.
24/04/2020, 17:07 - Muhammed: Use any of these options
24/04/2020, 17:08 - +234 817 965 1769: It's true na.


Some will want to install some packages that requires data while their data is off
24/04/2020, 17:10 - Muhammed: Is there any package that doesn't require data? Unless it's pre-installed.

Even if it's 20kb
24/04/2020, 17:11 - Muhammed: I hope you have about 1gb worth of data on your device before proceeding with the installation?
24/04/2020, 17:12 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol...

Some packages like software doesn't
24/04/2020, 17:12 - Muhammed: 🌚🌚🌚🌚
24/04/2020, 17:12 - +234 817 965 1769: But libraries in Python all requires data
24/04/2020, 17:12 - +234 817 965 1769: And they chop data pass one another
24/04/2020, 17:13 - Muhammed: Yeah
24/04/2020, 17:13 - Muhammed: Tensorflow and Pytorch chop data die
24/04/2020, 17:14 - +234 817 965 1769: Almost one gig don disapear before.


My offence is because I pressed

!pip install... on jupyter notebook
24/04/2020, 17:14 - Muhammed: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
24/04/2020, 17:20 - +234 817 965 1769: I can't cry. To change my laptop is usually somehow anytime I remember that I will have to install some packages again.


Install some softwares with internet again

24/04/2020, 17:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: My guy don vex 😀😀
24/04/2020, 17:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Now you know why we keep losing talents for Canada 😂

I'm sure you sef dey use Nigeria gain experience to japa
24/04/2020, 17:26 - +234 708 531 6273: Not even ordinary talent . Top talent.  Lmaoo
24/04/2020, 17:27 - +234 803 263 4711: Lol
What can we do.
24/04/2020, 17:28 - +234 706 067 7951: Exactly

24/04/2020, 17:32 - +234 708 531 6273: Well, they are winning and we might have to settle for that "less" . Companies are folding up and sacking people already. Some companies are also telling staff to expect the unexpected from next month. 

It seems many top talents will be roaming the streets of Lagos and Nigeria at large soon.😂
24/04/2020, 17:33 - +234 810 878 6913: Pls who stays at mowe ibafo in Ogun state here?

24/04/2020, 17:37 - +234 703 344 8466: The exploitation of such talent would be on another scale.. Laws of supply and demand + lax labour laws
24/04/2020, 17:38 - +234 708 531 6273: Chaii . It is well
24/04/2020, 17:45 - +234 816 765 1978: Nawa ooo....let's see what they have to say though

24/04/2020, 18:01 - +234 816 765 1978: 😂😂😂....but why would Sterling bank sponsor such a BS....like what message are they passing to their top talents... You folks deserve less....😩😩😩
24/04/2020, 18:08 - Olayinka: The topic dey funny self
24/04/2020, 18:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What if it's a strategy to draw attention
24/04/2020, 18:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What if?
24/04/2020, 18:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Which they have achieved👍
24/04/2020, 18:13 - +234 816 765 1978: That's why I'll definitely make sure I watch the stuff
24/04/2020, 18:13 - +234 818 936 4697: Or what if it is the cost of hiring.

24/04/2020, 22:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Check for outliers 

Determine the proportion of the outliers if it's large or infinitesimal

Check if there is anything informative about them, maybe you can create a new column to handle them

Or just normalize the column
24/04/2020, 22:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Or you can drop the outliers 

Your choice 

No one way 

Any way na way as long as you reach destination
24/04/2020, 22:36 - +234 817 965 1769: Boss has spoken
24/04/2020, 22:36 - +234 810 878 6913: You're part of them
24/04/2020, 22:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can transform is the algorithm you are using isn't robust to outliers, but most tree based are
24/04/2020, 22:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: ~is~
*If
24/04/2020, 22:38 - +234 810 878 6913: Normalization would be the best option then. Thanks
24/04/2020, 22:39 - Richie: Ok i just saw this
24/04/2020, 22:42 - Richie: Well i read @2348108522573 answer.. So i will just streamline mine to feature preprocessing.... If its right skwed data use nth root or log for transformation but if its left skwed use nth power or exp..

All things being equal you know what to do..
24/04/2020, 22:44 - +234 708 821 2432: Thank you
24/04/2020, 22:44 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks for this Sir
24/04/2020, 22:46 - Richie: The goal is to make it have a Guassian look or be Guassian but sometimes when you check for the p value for the transformation you did you will see it reject it sef..so the essence of transformation is bad.. For best practice in real life case.. Also check the p value of each column you transfrom.. Sometimes the error may be from data collection and you have little or nothing to do here
24/04/2020, 22:46 - Richie: But if na competition 🌝😁... Ooinnn
24/04/2020, 22:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Correct

Which is why I suggested the checking the outliers using the Gaussian boundary
24/04/2020, 22:47 - +234 810 878 6913: I will research on this then
24/04/2020, 22:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 🤣🤣🤣🤣

24/04/2020, 22:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's a competition thing
24/04/2020, 22:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Go Kaggle kernels 

You go see mad stacking

24/04/2020, 22:50 - Muhammed: Surely
24/04/2020, 22:51 - Muhammed: When it comes to competitions, boosting algos are the way to go
24/04/2020, 22:52 - Muhammed: Where are the Power BI gurus here, I need some help ó
24/04/2020, 22:52 - +234 803 464 8863: 😂😂😂
24/04/2020, 22:53 - +234 803 464 8863: There was this comedy DS skit one Silicon Valley guy did on Youtube that he was crying about how peeps were boosting everything. Did you see that?
24/04/2020, 22:54 - Muhammed: I have multiple tables I'm working with, but want to map continents (on a separate table) with countries (on another table)
24/04/2020, 22:54 - Muhammed: In a clearer term, I want to link the two tables, any help with this?
24/04/2020, 22:58 - Muhammed: Where are the Power BI gurus now 😭
24/04/2020, 22:59 - +234 803 464 8863: One hack/trick would be to take the tables to Excel first and do the mapping there and now import the query as one table to PQ..
24/04/2020, 23:00 - +234 803 464 8863: ..else, you'll have to write the DAX on a new custom column that will do the lookup
24/04/2020, 23:01 - Muhammed: I can't see anything here
24/04/2020, 23:02 - +234 803 464 8863: You're saying he should create a relationship between the tables, basically
24/04/2020, 23:02 - +234 803 464 8863: Can we see these tables? @2348108316393
24/04/2020, 23:02 - Obinna Iheanachor: I'll need to see the structure of the table to assist you.
One hack is to create a conditional column that returns the continent for every country. Then if the continent in the other table is distinct, you can create a relationship (one to many) based on that.
24/04/2020, 23:04 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No 

Make I see am 😀😀😀
24/04/2020, 23:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 🤟🏾
24/04/2020, 23:05 - Muhammed: Done that already, but not giving me the desired result
24/04/2020, 23:06 - Muhammed: The data is a live data, I'm working with it live from a Google Sheets file I created for daily updates of the data
24/04/2020, 23:07 - Muhammed: I can use Excel indeed, but I don't want to use the data offline
24/04/2020, 23:08 - Obinna Iheanachor: Okay cool. This is not distinct though. Is this the only column in this table?
24/04/2020, 23:08 - Muhammed: I extracted it
24/04/2020, 23:08 - Obinna Iheanachor: Let me the see the structure of the table where the countries are?
24/04/2020, 23:10 - Obinna Iheanachor: Is there a continent column there also?
24/04/2020, 23:14 - Obinna Iheanachor: From what I'm seeing, you want to link the first table which contains one column(Continent) to the second right?

You'll need to remove the duplicates in the first table so it just contains the distinct continent values.
Then create a relationship based on continents with second table that contains the other metadata.
This creates a one-to-many relationship.
24/04/2020, 23:15 - Muhammed: Continent is not contained in the dataset. I loaded the continent from web
24/04/2020, 23:17 - Obinna Iheanachor: The table that has all the data, I saw continents in a column there. I believe for each row of data, the corresponding continent for each country is given right?
24/04/2020, 23:17 - Muhammed: Nope
24/04/2020, 23:17 - Muhammed: Just the country
24/04/2020, 23:18 - Obinna Iheanachor: Okay, there are no continents in the parent table. You'll need to create a conditional column.
24/04/2020, 23:18 - Muhammed: Okay
24/04/2020, 23:18 - Obinna Iheanachor: Send me a Zoom link let's do this.
24/04/2020, 23:22 - +234 816 502 5257: You can add a custom by example column
24/04/2020, 23:22 - +234 816 502 5257: Type the continent and a hypen - then the country
24/04/2020, 23:23 - +234 816 502 5257: It will automatically fill down
24/04/2020, 23:23 - +234 816 502 5257: Then you can continue your work
24/04/2020, 23:23 - +234 816 502 5257: You want to link continent and country Abi!?
24/04/2020, 23:23 - +234 816 502 5257: Column

I don't know but I prefer horizontal bar charts.. They make chart easy to read, especially when the data labels have long words

The data labels in the pie chart isn't that visible but I guess the size of the color already tells the whole story.

Thank you very much
25/04/2020, 21:38 - +234 814 676 9743: Very insightful analysis. It's obvious that a professional did this. I saw the methodology I learnt in the course I'm currently taking in the analysis. 


Well done boss!
25/04/2020, 21:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Thanks fam!

You did have a point with the horizontal, I didn't consider it because I wanted to do a side by side comparison.

26/04/2020, 10:07 - +234 817 840 3767: *COVID-19: CAN AFRICA AFFORD* *LOCKDOWNS?* 
( *By Chukwuma Charles Soludo* )
 _Long read but worth every  second_ _spent doing so.  This is from a real_ intellectual. *Enjoy..* 

"This piece summarizes my contribution to an African debate. From Johannesburg to Lagos, Cairo to Dakar, Kinshasa to Kigali, Nairobi to Accra, etc the debate on how Africa should respond to the global coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is raging. At an African regional policy platform, I had expressed some of these (personal) views some weeks ago but have been encouraged by most members to circulate them in Africa beyond the platform.

This year 2020 begins a new decade that promises to be one of dreadful disruptions, with Africa holding the weakest end of the stick. In 2008/09, the global “great recession” was triggered by financial crisis in the US (world’s largest economy). Then, much of Africa was said to be decoupled from the crisis and muddled through without severe devastation of its economies. This year, a global health pandemic that has paused the global economy and certain to rail-road it into synchronized recession (if not depression) was triggered by the second largest economy, China. Unlike before, multilateralism and global coordination framework are at their weakest. National (local) self-defence is the rule. As before, the rich world with its generous welfare system and huge financial war chest, is taking care of itself (the US alone has US$2.2 trillion stimulus package). Africa is left to its fate.

Covid-19 caught the world totally unprepared, and with no proven and available medical response. Ad-hoc cocktails and learning-by-doing constitute the strategic package. In most western countries, the cocktail of response has included a coterie of defensive measures including: border closure; prepare isolation centres and mobilize medical personnel/facilities; implement “stay at home” orders or lockdowns except for food, medicine and essential services; campaign for basic hygiene and social distancing; arrange welfare packages for the vulnerable; and also economic stimulus packages to mitigate the effects on the macro economy. 

Many African countries have largely copied the above template, to varying degrees. Piece-meal extensions of “stay at home” or lockdown orders as in many western countries have also been copied in Africa. But the question is: can Africa really afford lockdowns, and can they be effective? Put differently, given the social and economic circumstances of Africa and the impending ‘economic pandemic’, can Africa successfully and sustainably defeat Covid-19 by copying the conventional trial-and-error template of the western nations? In confusion and desperation, the world seemed to be throwing any and everything at the pandemic. Recall President Trump’s assertion that hydroxychloroquine “might help”? The evidence so far (from limited sample) is that it probably actually worsens the disease. The trial and error have left huge human toll and economic ruins, and there is still no solution.

Let us be clear: no one can blame African policymakers for the initial panicky copy and paste response some weeks ago. No public officer wanted to be blamed for doing nothing or not doing what others were doing. After these initial pilot schemes, it is now time to ask the deep question: Is this the right approach for Africa? 

All lives matter and African governments must do everything to protect or save every life from the pandemic. The challenge is how. Africa faces two unsavoury options: the conventional template, including lockdowns versus heterodox (creative local) approaches without lockdowns. Both have risks and potential benefits. Sadly, people will still get the disease and die under both approaches. People will differ on the choice, depending on what is on their decision matrix: data, resources, subjective preferences, and interests, etc. I focus on which option (on a net basis) is achievable in the short to medium term, consistent with our social and economic realities.

Our thesis is that lockdowns in Africa suffer time-inconsistency problem without a credible exit strategy; is unaffordable and could potentially worsen the twin pandemic—health and economic—in Africa. We call for Africa to press the reset button now, mainstream its collective, simple, smart learning-by-doing solutions that could, in the end, be the African solutions for export to the world. Covid-19 won’t be the end of techno-economic disruptions or health pandemics even in this decade: this is an opportunity to think without the box—to engender greater self-confidence in our capacity to think through our problems, with authentic sustainable solutions.

Let me illustrate why I believe that a strategy that includes lockdowns/border closure is the worse of the two options given our social and economic realities. (Recall that China isolated Wuhan, and kept Shanghai, Beijing, and other major economic engines open, and today, China supplies the world with medical equipment, face masks, etc and raking-in hundreds of billions of dollars). The idea of a lockdown (and border closure) implies that you will continue to do so (with extensions) until such a time that you are satisfied that the spread of Covid-19 has been arrested or on the decline (with the possibility of imposing another round of lockdown if new infections surge). That is the catch: lockdown for as long as required to stem the spread. The length of time required for such lockdowns to ensure “effectiveness” in arresting the spread would make it near impossible in much of Africa. If the strategy is to lockdown until infections stop/significantly decline or so, then we would have a suicidal indefinite waiting game. 

First, monitoring the spread requires effective testing, and Africa cannot afford effective testing of its 1.3 billion people. New York State, with a population of 20 million and a budget of $175 billion, is pleading with the US Federal Government to assist with testing kits and facilities. Check out the number of testing centres and facilities in each African country relative to their populations. A joke in the social media narrated that the health minister of Burundi was asked to explain the miracle in his country whereby the number of infections was reported as zero. His response was: “it is simple: we don’t have any testing kits”. Besides, there is stigma associated with the infection, and on the average Africans only go to the hospital as the last resort. There are also asymptomatic cases, and only the critically ill ones will report. So, there will always be massive under-testing, and gross under reporting. 

Furthermore, social distancing in most parts of Africa will remain impractical. From the shanties in South Africa’s townships to the crowded Ajengule or Mararaba in Abuja/Nasarawa, or Cairo or Kinshasa to the villages and poor neighbourhoods in much of Africa, social clustering, not distancing, is the affordable, survivalist culture. Communal living is not just about culture, it is a matter of economic survival. Hence, the statistics on infections will be coming in fits and stats: shall we be locking down and unlocking with each episode of surge as there may probably be several such episodes (unless and until a cure is found)? Even with over four weeks of “stay at home” or lockdowns in some African countries, the reported daily infections continue to rise. Some may argue the counterfactual that without the initial lockdowns, the number of infections could have been multiples. It is a reasonable conjecture or anecdote, albeit without any proof. The question is the end game for a poor society such as Africa? New infections have re-emerged in Wuhan, and both Singapore and South Korea are going back to the drawing board. Since we cannot sustain lockdowns indefinitely or even until the spread stops/declines, it means that we would sooner or later remove the restrictions. What happens then? There would still be infections, which can still spread anyway. Why not then adopt sustainable solutions early enough without weeks of avoidable waste and hardship? Let us think this through!

Next, African states cannot pay for lockdowns. Many countries depend on budget support from bilateral and multilateral donors, and with acute balance of payments problems. They do not even have leg rooms to simply print money. Most are now begging for debt relief and applying for urgent loans from the IMF and the World Bank. In Africa, both the governments and the people are begging for “palliatives”. The most that African states and their private charities can do is “photo charity”—with much fanfare, drop a few currency notes or grains here and there for some thousands when millions are in desperate need, just to be seen to have “done something”. At a fundamental level, most African states do not have credible demographic data to identify and target the most vulnerable. In the western societies from where we copied the lockdown/border closure, their citizens are literally paid to stay at home (by silently dropping monies into their accounts plus other incentives). Check out the trillions of dollars, Euros, and pounds in support to the vulnerable and stimulus packages. Despite these, check out the restiveness/protests in several of these countries and the unrelenting pressure to eliminate the restrictions (even in countries where thousands are dying each day due to Covid-19). Given that no government in Africa can seriously pay for lockdowns, over one billion Africans are left to survive if they can or perish if they must.

Without government support, no more than 5% of Africa’s 1.3 billion people can possibly survive any prolonged lockdown on their own finances. Most of the others have no assets or savings to live on for any prolonged period, and there is no social insurance (welfare system). Without the pandemic, the African economic space is already in dire straits, with unacceptable unemployment rate (especially youth unemployment) as well as endemic poverty. In 2007, I evaluated the structure of deposits in Nigerian banks and found that only 8% of the bank accounts had balances of N300,000 (over $2,500 then) and above, and these accounted for 95% of the total deposits. The remaining 92% of bank accounts had 5% of total deposits. I understand that a recent study showed that only 2% of bank accounts had N500,000 (about $1,300) and above. Also imagine the dependency burden on this 2%. The dearth of infrastructure (basic electricity is deficient) makes compulsion to stay at home hellish for most people. We have lockdowns in Africa but without pausing several pressures for private expenditures on the people: monthly house rents; banks’ interest payments for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), electricity charges, etc.

With some 80% of Africa’s population living from hand to mouth on daily toil and hassle, complete lockdown would never be total, almost impossible in our social settings. In most cases, the orders simply create opportunities for extortion for the security agencies: those who pay, move about! Attempts to force everyone into a lockdown for extended period may indeed be enforcing a hunger/stress-induced mass genocide. More people could, consequently, be dying out of hunger and other diseases than the actual Covid-19. In normal times, thousands die every day in Africa due to other illnesses and communicable diseases—cholera, malaria, lassa fever, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, heart diseases, stroke, HIV/AIDS, yellow fever, zika virus, measles, hepatitis, typhoid, small pox, Ebola, Rift valley fever, monkey pox, chikungunya virus, pregnancy and child-birth related deaths, renal failure; pneumonia, etc. 

Lockdowns worsen these as many of the victims of these now have little or no cash to attend to themselves. Soon the pharmacy shops will run out of imported drugs. Even local pharmaceutical manufacturing firms need imported inputs but cannot efficiently source them under lockdowns/border closure (even more so with restrictions in China and India). Soon local, adulterated ones may fill the gap. A summary point is that the millions of persons in the street, who are struggling between life and death each day with numerous other challenges do not, and will never, understand why so much additional hardship is being foisted upon them because of the novel coronavirus. For most of them (wrongly though), it is an elite problem since for them, the “hunger/other disease virus is more dangerous than corona virus”. The hungry and desperate millions may be forced to take desperate actions to survive, and little surprise that crime has spiked in several African countries with lockdowns.

What many do not seem to appreciate is that African economies are facing their worst economic condition in decades. Commodity prices have fallen dramatically, and for oil producers, the situation is precarious. IMF predicts that aggregate Africa will fall into a recession this year (the first in over two decades) but possibly rebound next year. For oil producers, it all depends on what happens to oil prices in the coming months and how they creatively craft a plan to transition to the world with little or no oil. If appropriate measures are not taken quickly, some oil producers may slide into depression. But border closures/lockdowns that dramatically affect the labour market and supply side (as well as demand side) of the economy will only worsen the situation, especially with little or no room for effective fiscal/monetary stimulus. Government revenues will be severely affected.

Thousands of MSMEs will die under the weight of formal and informal loans, bills (rents, electricity, wages, interest, etc) that continue to accumulate under lockdowns as well as low demand for their goods and services. Some countries are busy “announcing” fantastic figures of helpline for the MSMEs (and much of it will end at the announcements) but without a clear path to address the legacy burden on the firms--- the persisting bills! Most of the owners of the MSMEs will probably consume their business capital during the lockdowns, with no clear helpline afterwards. The US Senate just passed a bill for $484 billion “More Small-Business Stimulus”, including a $320 billion “Paycheck Protection Program” to enable small businesses pay their staff salaries for two months. This follows the exhaustion of earlier $350 billion for small businesses under the $2.2 trillion stimulus package. The above is just an example of what western countries from whom we copied the lockdown strategy are doing for their MSMEs—which Africa cannot afford. 

Millions of poor farmers will be hard hit. Their perishable products that need the informal public transport to reach the cities will be wasted; while millions that need transport to their farms cannot do so. Agriculture in Africa is rain-fed and seasonal. Lockdowns during the planting season could threaten food security in months ahead. Inflation will shoot up in many African countries, and with critical food shortages later. Manufacturing firms need imported inputs, machinery, and spare parts. Countries under lockdowns are consuming their old stocks. Even after lifting the lockdowns/border closure, it may take months for normalcy to return in some countries.

Each day that any of the major African economies stays under lockdown costs Africa billions of dollars in lost income but with debatable benefits. Given its financial and structural weaknesses, Africa does not have the luxury of using the same “conventional tools” of the western countries in the face of the twin pandemic. At the minimum, Africa needs its full population (its most important asset) working at full throttle to have any chance of defeating the impending economic catastrophe.

What should Africa do?

We should think African but act locally and opportunistically to survive and prosper, and exploit the global opportunities offered by the crises. Every shock or pandemic presents opportunities. Solutions need to be multidimensional, far beyond economics and western medicine. Ad-hoc response will be a wasted opportunity. Africa needs a package for creating sustainable prosperity in a world of continuous techno-economic-health disruptions. Such disruptions will become the new normal in the decades ahead, and we should better get used to that. Only societies that anticipate and plan for such disruptions will opportunistically exploit them, while others mourn and blame the shocks. The way we work, socialize, meet etc will not be the same after these crises. Welcome to the decade of rapid creative destructions!

As a first step, African countries should urgently dismantle the border closures as well as the stay at home/lockdown orders. Hopefully, some useful data were gathered, and lessons learnt that will help in crafting simple, smart, and sustainable heterodox responses. Africa cannot afford lockdowns that will prove ineffective anyway.

Opening Africa does not mean abdication of responsibility by the governments. Governments should lead in the mobilization, education, and possibly equipment of the people to take personal responsibility for their safety; mainstream the African spirit of community/collective action by mobilizing the churches, mosques and civil society organizations to lead in the public education and mobilization; and finally for the government to do its utmost best in providing public healthcare.  An enduring lesson of this pandemic is that African countries must take public healthcare seriously. There will be future health pandemics and we should better get ready today. Professionals, religious leaders, CSOs and community leaders should be mobilized to agree on simple, smart solutions consistent with our financial and social realities. Our western and local (herbal) medical experts and research institutions should all be mobilized to come up with solutions. Those with pre-existing conditions might receive special treatment. The president of Madagascar is reported to have announced that his country has found its own cure for Covid-19 and has ordered schools also to reopen. The west is still on a trial-and-error mode, and why shouldn’t we experiment as well? Africa fought and survived Ebola without lockdowns and we can do even better this time. 

Our model should be learning-by-doing while mainstreaming basic common-sense tips such as: mandatory wearing of masks in public, basic hygiene, disinfection of all open markets every early morning and all places of public gatherings, practical social distancing tips, provision of hand washing facilities in public places, production and use of hand sanitizers, gloves, etc.  For example, all public transport vehicles—taxi, buses, trains, airplanes might require disinfection of the vehicle before use, and for all passengers to wear masks and with hand sanitizers. Can you imagine the thousands of jobs to be created in producing face masks, hand sanitizers, gloves, etc for 1.3 billion people? But this cannot happen under a lockdown. New opportunities! Everyone wants to live, and Africans will learn and adapt quickly. Staying at home will become a choice, not a compulsion. The slogan could be: “stay at home if you can, or smartly go to work if you must”. We can only defeat the challenge by confronting it, and not by playing the Ostrich only to still confront it the day after.

Every African society has some local herbs that, to use President Trump’s phrase, “might help”. While the UK and others are experimenting with vaccines, you never know if an Africa herb might be the cure. Necessity is the mother of invention, and only those who dare, succeed! With enough education and mobilization, the infection rate will be drastically reduced without pausing the lives of 1.3 billion people.

The real challenge is the potential economic catastrophe that many African economies face. How policymakers respond depends on how they interpret the shocks: as temporary or permanent structural shifts. But howsoever they choose to see it, one thing is certain: several more similar shocks (not necessarily in exact form) are on the way. 

What is evident so far is that most African policymakers (typically) think of the shocks as temporary, and consequently seem to believe that they can just stimulate their way out of it and wait for the next one. African multilateral financial institutions (e.g. AfDB and Afreximbank) have announced packages to assist Africa ride over the shocks. The World Bank and the IMF have provided quick disbursing windows for us to borrow. African finance ministers have called for moratorium on debt servicing, and most have applied for the cheap loans from Washington. Several African countries have “announced” intervention funds that, at best, constitute a drop in the ocean relative to need. The buffers and institutions for dynamic adjustments are weak or absent. In most countries, subnational governments are pleading for bailouts from their cash-strapped central governments. Many of these subnational governments will soon realize that they are basically on their own, and many could become fiscally insolvent. 

After most African countries empty all their piggy banks now, and borrow their full tranches at the Fund and the World Bank, secured moratorium on existing debt etc, what happens with the next disruption in a few years’ time? Or like the African musician, Oliver de Coque sang: “let us enjoy life today, and after that we can worry about tomorrow”? But that tomorrow is a few hours away. Because of these crises, many African currencies (especially the oil producers) might likely depreciate significantly. Servicing these external debts tomorrow with the exchange rate then, would require heavy lifting. But it is difficult to see how a competitive real effective exchange rate regime will not be a critical component of their comprehensive strategy for diversification and global competitiveness.

Politicians with short-term electoral cycles typically have short time horizons or suffer policy myopia. This is not just an African problem. It is a typical problem of multiparty democracies with short term electoral cycles and term limits. However, extreme cases abound in some African states especially because the civil service (that ought to ensure longer term continuity) is very weak. With eyes on the next election, opportunistic populism wins. Rather than confront the underlying structural dysfunction, the easiest escape is to pile up debts and contingent liabilities. This is the circularity that has brought Africa to the present embarrassment whereby barely some years after massive debt cancellations/reliefs from our creditors, we are again pleading for “debt relief”. But several future shocks are on the way. When and how can African countries escape this circular trap? This is a short question but with a long answer. Each country’s economic/development team should get to serious work.

For the countries that see the shocks as signalling structural shifts (which it largely is), the focus should be on exploiting the opportunities offered by the crises to press the re-set button. It requires a realistic diagnosis and admission that the existing business model has been rendered obsolete. Crafting a new business model that encompasses the whole range of institutional, technological, structural, macroeconomic, and even politico-governance arrangements takes time and demands for disruptive thinking. It would require mainstreaming creative non-debt-creating financing options and new forms of economic partnerships. But these require longer-term perspectives and a form of inter-generational planning. There lies the conflict versus the opportunity and points to what separates politicians from statesmen. Politicians think of the next election, while statesmen think of the next generation. We pray for Africa’s political statesmen (a seeming contradictory combination—be a politician and statesman at the same time). That is why I strongly support the re-opening of all of Africa urgently, and let all hands get to work to help them succeed."

I went through the notebook and saw something ah dinnor understand
26/04/2020, 14:50 - +234 814 676 9743: 1. Why did you replace the categorical features with mode after cleaning the data.

2. When applying a function you defined to clean the data, why did you use the.transform method? Why not use .apply?
26/04/2020, 14:51 - +234 814 676 9743: @2348108522573
26/04/2020, 14:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's a Storytelling Projects not a Predictive Analytics of model building, so I wasn't so much bothered about the best imputations, so I just went straight for model to replace missing data.

For transform it's a bit more flexible in some cases then apply
26/04/2020, 14:55 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I use apply too, but it can be memory consuming for a large dataset which is why Numpy iterations are considered as best practises when you need to loop through large data.

Transform similar to apply though

*Abideen Muhammed*

Starting a career in data analysis or science sometimes can be a deceit especially when you could not go far as expected. To add to the injury, you see others discussing new things they have learnt and the project they just completed when you are yet to start; It can cause setback and make you to feel like you are not doing well and that perhaps this is not your field.


 Most of us started wrongly, with the mindset that there’s money in it. Let me dive in to make it. Those who introduced us to the field too almost ‘lied’ to us by telling us what we wanted to hear which is somehow far from the truth.

Most of the times, they will tell you that to become a data scientist, you don’t need to know mathematics like, it is just what you were taught in secondary schools. However, when you started, they told you that to go far you need to learn this and that. Statistical and probabilistic concepts that are new to you were introduced. Python you thought could be mastered within just one-month class is taking six months yet you are not sure of mastering it in the next six months. So, at this point, you felt they deceived or lured you into data science.

We should check for outliers in the dependent variables .

By Wayan Vota on April 28, 2020

Governments and civil society in low- and middle-income countries often lack the digital infrastructure to capture, share, and use data in the timescales and distance needed for COVID-19 Digital Response.
There is an international effort to invest in data capture and analysis methodologies and technologies for LMICs so they can better respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Yet development organizations worry that some of these digital tools come with:
•	Significant privacy and security implications
•	Under-represent of certain populations
•	Undermine existing data-reporting structures
How can solution providers and development organizations include clear standards and core ICT4D approaches as they select, design, and implement digital development technology?
£500,000 DFID Grant Funding
The DFID Frontier Technologies Hub COVID Action Data Challenge invites you to submit data innovations that can support LMICs with up to £50,000 per solution in the following categories:
•	Data-use solutions that support data integration and analysis
•	Data sources and collection tools that inform response
•	Epidemiological modelling to support response and planning
•	Responsible data needs in COVID-19 data systems
Selected applicants can receive a mix of support, including grant funding for rapid deployment and matchmaking with DFID and other donors for additional resources at a virtual showcase on or around 20 May, 2020.  #COVIDAction
Apply Now! Deadline is May 9, 2020

29/04/2020, 23:05 - Obinna Iheanachor: I'll love to share some useful resources that have helped me so far in my Power BI journey.

Microsoft's Power BI course on edX was the first course I took on Power BI and is a good place to start for those looking to start exploring the Power BI software. 
https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-power-bi-7

The next course I took was the Intermediate course at BI Elite Training. There's currently 3 courses offered on this platform; a beginner course, an intermediate course and a course for those preparing for the DA-100 Power BI certification exam. There's a 1 week free trial going on and you can take advantage of this platform and access any of these courses. If you have no experience with Power BI, I'll advise you start with the beginner course. For those looking to enhance their skills, you can check out the intermediate course. 
https://training.bielite.com/courses/

Here are some amazing YouTube channels where you'll find some of the best Power BI content:

BI Elite: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-h-wArcxJC8zBOD-UxfCOg

Archive them for later use when you need to catch up with some learnings.

29/04/2020, 23:25 - +234 816 502 5257: Absolutely begginner
29/04/2020, 23:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Andrew Ng Machine Learning course
29/04/2020, 23:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Start with that please
29/04/2020, 23:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's the best out there
29/04/2020, 23:26 - +234 816 502 5257: Where's that
29/04/2020, 23:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Coursera
29/04/2020, 23:27 - +234 816 502 5257: Thank you very much
29/04/2020, 23:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The course was done in Octave though not Python but the knowledge/theory is legendary, take you through the rudiment and Understanding behind ML.


So I will recommend forget the Certificate, understand the concepts and do the assignment using Python
29/04/2020, 23:29 - +234 816 502 5257: I will learn python separately?
29/04/2020, 23:29 - +234 816 502 5257: My python knowledge is rusty
29/04/2020, 23:30 - +234 816 502 5257: Thank you very much all the same
29/04/2020, 23:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That one sef dey 

Rough am learn 

Solutions are available online for python for the course, so you can use that as support system.

N:B - The goal of the course is to help you have a good grasp of ML, for python for ML there is another course you can take just to have a grasp of it
29/04/2020, 23:33 - +234 816 502 5257: OK, great
29/04/2020, 23:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can check out

A-Z ML by krill on Udemy

Python for Data Science on Udemy 

With the two combo you should have a good grasp of Python for ML/DS 

When you are done you can play with Kaggle small so you are not just taking courses 

After start reading books to further strengthen knowledge of some concepts that were rushed in some of those concepts, and this will be a life long learning 🤟🏾

You should be fine
29/04/2020, 23:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No be you wan turn Data Scientist😀😀
29/04/2020, 23:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You think say na moimoi to turn claim that title say "I'm a Data scientist😀😀😀, sexiest job in the 21st century"

You dunno
29/04/2020, 23:37 - +234 818 534 6200: As in
29/04/2020, 23:37 - +234 816 502 5257: I don't know
29/04/2020, 23:38 - +234 818 534 6200: You have to put in the work.
No be beans boss
29/04/2020, 23:38 - +234 816 502 5257: Wow.. You guys have gone through a lot o
29/04/2020, 23:38 - +234 816 502 5257: You guys talk about it here like beans
29/04/2020, 23:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Ise ase kara😀
29/04/2020, 23:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Scam

So many things still look like puzzle 😂😂

Na so e be

I still dey slide in DM to ask for resources and guide sef
29/04/2020, 23:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So we gather dey 🤟🏾
29/04/2020, 23:39 - +234 816 502 5257: Is it the one that has tensor flow too
29/04/2020, 23:40 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Leave this realm first  😀😀
29/04/2020, 23:40 - +234 816 502 5257: I hear it more often here
29/04/2020, 23:40 - +234 818 534 6200: This career is lifelong mhennn and ever changing. You just have to put in the work
29/04/2020, 23:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: RT😀
29/04/2020, 23:41 - +234 816 502 5257: I just want to make it in life and have kids
29/04/2020, 23:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: But it depends sha 

You can define the realm you want to play though
29/04/2020, 23:42 - +234 816 502 5257: You people have different mission?
29/04/2020, 23:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You may decide to play in the BI/Analytics space or the DS/ML space with very few competitions because it requires lot of technicality and only few have that doggedness to enter the dirty core terrain to learn the hard nut and be good at it.

So it's a question of where do you want to play or most importantly are you learning with global opportunities in view?
29/04/2020, 23:44 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If you are learning just for 9ja believe me you don't need to stress yourself actually 😂, but if you have Canada in view my guy you go learn am well to global standard
29/04/2020, 23:44 - +234 703 397 0467: 😂😊😘
29/04/2020, 23:44 - +234 811 624 5920: Baba thanks...

29/04/2020, 23:46 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You are doing fine then 

Why are you now asking for ML guide then
29/04/2020, 23:46 - +234 703 397 0467: Actually, what drove me to Data Science is to av a skill dt I can sell abroad
29/04/2020, 23:46 - +234 816 502 5257: Someone asked me to learn that as well
29/04/2020, 23:47 - +234 816 502 5257: I'm confused now
29/04/2020, 23:48 - +234 818 534 6200: Dont let anybody deceive. People have said a million times here. Dont fall victim for information overload

29/04/2020, 23:56 - Muhammed: You never finish intro to ML, you wan run go deep Learning, egungun be careful
29/04/2020, 23:57 - +234 818 368 5814: If it's DS nko

29/04/2020, 23:59 - Muhammed: 💯 💯 💯
29/04/2020, 23:59 - Muhammed: Just warning him ni
29/04/2020, 23:59 - +234 818 368 5814: So it will be something like  Excel and PowerBI/Tableau well,  along with SQL for query and python
30/04/2020, 00:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Oriepe
30/04/2020, 00:01 - Muhammed: Yeah, first learn BI, transitioning to DS/AI shouldn't be a problem for you afterwards (not in all cases sha)
30/04/2020, 00:02 - Muhammed: I was trying to work on some tf models earlier yesterday, the data size made me run away. I'll source for alternatives on Kaggle, so I'll just import and run from Kaggle Kernel
30/04/2020, 00:03 - +234 818 368 5814: 😂😂😂
30/04/2020, 00:04 - +234 818 368 5814: Alright boss.. 

Thanks
30/04/2020, 00:04 - Muhammed: Already used over 3gb yesterday, downloading Datasets from tf database
30/04/2020, 00:12 - +234 818 368 5814: The python is the general purpose or python for ML
30/04/2020, 00:15 - +234 703 344 8466: I love this
30/04/2020, 00:15 - Muhammed: Python for ML/DS
30/04/2020, 00:15 - Muhammed: Not all Python programmers are Data Scientists.
30/04/2020, 00:16 - +234 810 878 6913: True
30/04/2020, 00:16 - Muhammed: Some use Python for web development (Django and/or Flask)
30/04/2020, 00:17 - +234 818 368 5814: Before taking ML, should I know much or just basics of linear algebra, stats & probability
30/04/2020, 00:17 - Muhammed: If you go into cloud computing, you'll still learn Python for automation and deployment
30/04/2020, 00:18 - Muhammed: I'd say much, ML goes beyond just knowing mean, median, mode (though, you must have the basic knowledge), but as you advance, you get to know better.
30/04/2020, 00:19 - Muhammed: Get the basics, develop yourself as you go further/deeper
30/04/2020, 00:20 - Muhammed: Most of the magic we learnt in our undergraduate days, are just becoming meaningful and applicable through DS
30/04/2020, 00:21 - +234 810 878 6913: Interesting
30/04/2020, 00:23 - +234 703 397 0467: Fact

One concept I understand before the journey is information overload but you may not understand.
30/04/2020, 07:16 - +234 817 965 1769: And one thing is we learn some software then dumb it. Later we will forget. You need to learn how to play around it too.

30/04/2020, 19:06 - +234 706 706 9323: Can someone please help me with a guide shared some time ago?
30/04/2020, 19:14 - Muhammed: Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

Ans)I’m a student from India and want to learn Blockchain Technology. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship,it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.I want to take this course as I want to learn.This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

Ans)My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Blockchain Technology and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge.This course will help me in defining Blockchain Technology,understanding how Blockchain could potentially impact our business and industry,to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Blockchain technology,explain Blockchain Technology to clients, friends,joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak.Identifying which aspects of Blockchain Technology seem most important and relevant to us,Walking away with a strong foundation in where blockchain is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Blockchain course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past.

Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.

Ans)Simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.

In case you want to join us in the next adventure, class open May 11

Please note this is not the regular self paced o, MiT kill you there, you miss assignments or deadlines you lose grade, deep dive into concepts , so it's a rigorous one, however the joy is we have a group taking it together, the first course started in January and we are about finishing in 2 weeks time with the final exam.

Do let me know if you are interested


*PS* : Don't rush into it unless you think it will align with your learning/career goals and that's why I'm dropping it here to give ample time to plan and think before enrolling.

30/04/2020, 23:10 - Olayinka: Let's do Fundamentals of Statistics next. That one self go hard but we go rough am
30/04/2020, 23:10 - +234 808 325 6441: Sure we should
30/04/2020, 23:10 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Actually from past reviews the first is the hardest, so I believe other courses will be chilling
30/04/2020, 23:10 - +234 808 325 6441: See this man
30/04/2020, 23:11 - +234 808 325 6441: Hopefully
30/04/2020, 23:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I give it to MiT🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿

They've got real application questions, you go think tire 

Really looking forward to the Statistics actually
30/04/2020, 23:12 - Olayinka: Yes...
30/04/2020, 23:12 - +234 808 325 6441: If it’s just one person taking it ehn
30/04/2020, 23:12 - Olayinka: They person for don quite
30/04/2020, 23:12 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Truth is one person can't take that thing unless it's full time like you are a full time student
30/04/2020, 23:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's not possible working and taking that MiT alone 

YOU WILL QUIT
30/04/2020, 23:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: it's not possible
30/04/2020, 23:13 - Olayinka: I read one lady's post on LinkedIn.. She wanted to do their Economics MicroMasters
30/04/2020, 23:13 - Olayinka: She said she quitted

30/04/2020, 23:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The questions are too hard 

Very hard from normality 

See guys from Canada and other countries getting angry that the questions are hard and they dropped out
30/04/2020, 23:14 - Olayinka: As full time student. You will explore some other materials
30/04/2020, 23:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yes, my colleague at work 

She dropped out because it was too hard
30/04/2020, 23:14 - Olayinka: Oh.. I didn't even know.
30/04/2020, 23:14 - +234 808 325 6441: I remember the pic @2348120919501 sent when the guy was lamenting

30/04/2020, 23:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I shock too
30/04/2020, 23:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Not like that it's because of the benefit that attach with passing the courses
30/04/2020, 23:20 - +234 816 502 5257: 😁
30/04/2020, 23:20 - +234 808 325 6441: True sha
30/04/2020, 23:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You know it's a waiver for some schools if you have the passing credentials, so I guess that's why she need it
30/04/2020, 23:20 - +234 814 676 9743: Some of those things I've done in school, buh the course made me realized that na introduction ah do for sch

My Hod has been using his teaching material since 30 years ago
30/04/2020, 23:24 - +234 813 730 6439: Chai...  Education in Africa is whack...
30/04/2020, 23:24 - +234 817 965 1769: I am doing one degree course online presently.

It's International Open University. Oh boy, everything I did I school for three years we used a semester to finish everything
30/04/2020, 23:25 - Olayinka: Some of us are going into the academia to change the face to the extend God gives us power
30/04/2020, 23:25 - Olayinka: Those of you going to industry. Hold industry tight for us.
30/04/2020, 23:27 - Olayinka: A firm’s data science presence can be bolstered by engaging academic data scientists.
There are several ways of doing this. For those academics interested in practical appli‐
cations of their work, it may be possible to fund their research programs. Both of your
authors, when working in industry, funded academic programs and essentially extended
the data science team that was focusing on their problems and interacting. The best
arrangement (by our experience) is a combination of data, money, and an interesting
business problem; if the project ends up being a portion of the Ph.D. thesis of a student
in a top-notch program, the benefit to the firm can far outweigh the cost. Funding a
Ph.D. student might cost a firm in the ballpark of $50K/year, which is a fraction of the
fully loaded cost of a top data scientist. A key is to have enough understanding of data
science to select the right professor—one with the appropriate expertise for the problem
at hand.
30/04/2020, 23:27 - Olayinka: An excerpt from the book Data Science for Business
30/04/2020, 23:29 - +234 817 965 1769: God, if they get data science as department for University.

01/05/2020, 10:05 - +234 816 381 5935: License key not functional
01/05/2020, 10:06 - +234 816 381 5935: I even tried the options specified in the .txt file, but no way

01/05/2020, 13:01 - +234 806 513 1448: Pls can anyone recommend a good python course from beginner to expert that will cover the different libraries and machine learning?
01/05/2020, 13:01 - +234 806 513 1448: I don’t mind paying but not so expensive
01/05/2020, 13:02 - +234 810 878 6913: Yes

01/05/2020, 13:03 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can only get a course that gives you a good fundamental then you can build on with time and get better, so no single course can give that because it's a cumulative learning
01/05/2020, 13:03 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I will recommend such fundamental courses

01/05/2020, 17:54 - +234 905 074 5130: Why I didn't use filter.

There's so many states with cases.
Filter will make it messy.

02/05/2020, 09:36 - Obinna Iheanachor: Taking up Certification Courses on Udemy, Coursera #Udacity, and likes are great, but again, let your work speak, I am more ascribed to the school of “proof of work is better than words and branding”. 

Prove that what you have learnt is valuable and beneficial through solving real-world meaningful problems that positively impact our communities and derive value for businesses. 

The data science models have no value without any real experiments or deployed solutions”. Focus on doing meaningful work that has real value to business and it should be quantifiable through real experiments/deployed in a production system. 

 If hiring you is a good business decision, companies will line up to hire you and what determines that you are a good decision is simple: Profit. You are an asset of value if only your skills are valuable.

Please don’t get deluded, simple projects don’t demonstrate problem-solving. Everyone is doing them. These projects are simple or stupid or useless copy paste and not at all useful. 

Be different and build a track record of practical solutions and keep solving more complex projects.

02/05/2020, 12:43 - +234 810 878 6913: Still didn't work
02/05/2020, 12:46 - +234 807 344 5187: Pandas Concatenation no longer has sort keyword argument
02/05/2020, 12:49 - +234 810 878 6913: Ah! So what am I going to use?
02/05/2020, 12:49 - +234 810 878 6913: I should remove the sort?
02/05/2020, 12:49 - +234 807 344 5187: update your pandas to version 0.23.0 and it will work
02/05/2020, 12:49 - +234 810 878 6913: Done
02/05/2020, 12:49 - +234 810 878 6913: I remove the sort
02/05/2020, 12:49 - +234 807 344 5187: pip install pandas=0.23.0
02/05/2020, 12:50 - +234 807 344 5187: but you can still use the sort if you update your pandas
02/05/2020, 12:50 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay
02/05/2020, 13:21 - +234 813 948 5182: Google used the anonymous location data it collects from Android phones to build global indices of how much people have stopped moving around, for every country and major city.

03/05/2020, 10:24 - +234 703 344 8466: 🤔
03/05/2020, 10:25 - +234 807 344 5187: Do you want to annualized the data on power bi?
03/05/2020, 10:26 - +234 703 344 8466: I want to do some visualisations using tableau
03/05/2020, 10:28 - +234 807 344 5187: Oh I don’t know about tableau but I can tell you how to link your power bi directly to data.world so that when the data is updated on the site, it will be updated on your report real time. Most of the covid 19 data are updated daily
03/05/2020, 10:30 - +234 703 344 8466: Wow.. I haven't started with power Bi yet unfortunately 😢
03/05/2020, 10:30 - +234 807 344 5187: Let me drop this here for those that might need it

03/05/2020, 11:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This nigga oversimplified the role actually. I drop a link on the hierarchy of AI which elucidate on the fact that not all organizations have the structure to get the best from Data Science and AI , and from the hierarchy having a Data architecture where the Database developer /Data Engineer sit, so if these are absent then the role of a Data scientist or AI guy will be useless and almost no needed which an Analyst may thrive a bit.

Most importantly as someone said which is very true "Don't jump into a field because of the hype"
03/05/2020, 12:02 - +234 803 420 2314: 😁 i got this last night as i was sourcing for the dataset online also
03/05/2020, 12:03 - +234 803 420 2314: Noted
03/05/2020, 12:05 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348073445187 please do you have an idea on integrating this process on tableau? 🥺
03/05/2020, 12:22 - Obinna Iheanachor: Very true. Fact is very few organisations have the structure and enabling environment to get the best out of Data Scientists.
Something else I gleaned from the whole convo is that Data Scientists need to start investing in soft skills like effective communication, business management etc. If you can't show tangible value from your work to your Boss or convince him to adopt your proposed solutions, you'll soon be out of a job.
I'll sure check out the link you dropped.
03/05/2020, 12:32 - Richie: Ok this is where my Bsc in management finally comes to play.. 😂😂.. I thought its for burning...
03/05/2020, 12:35 - Richie: We are talking of companies in Nigeria not ready for DS, DE etc.. Even the country isn't ready... Check major Ministries even the dem dem money guys don't have... If not ehy will one be bothered if finance house catch fire... Well i know.. I work with one... Even if you get there.. 😂😂😂.. Your analysis is for play... Unless you have a reasonable boss
03/05/2020, 12:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Well, communication is the last in the CRISP-DM, so it is expected you must have that soft skills , majority of what you will be doing aside the code is storytelling and persuading the stakeholders to believe in what you say DS can do.

I'm currently learning that from my boss each time I follow her to pitch decks or stakeholders meeting, I will just be blushing say mehn "No be by skills alone o", business no send your skills o
03/05/2020, 12:39 - Richie: Business needs money and money and more money.. If its not influencing money.. Park well.. Lets hope someday we convince the Ministries to consider this path.. I will keep trying my best and i am sure it will count soon...
03/05/2020, 12:40 - Richie: For government ministries @2349079382247 you remember the work we did and the money it attracted... Them no even reason us😂😂... But we are happy it was used
03/05/2020, 12:41 - Richie: I can't forget that day.. Data analysis burst petrol theft.. 😂😂
03/05/2020, 12:41 - Richie: Who will bail the cat... After some months  transferred can calling ..... 😂😂😂
03/05/2020, 12:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂
03/05/2020, 12:45 - Obinna Iheanachor: Very informative link you shared man. I just wish we can print it and send a copy to all these companies that are yet to embrace data literacy and are looking for Data Scientists to come and do magic.
03/05/2020, 12:45 - Obinna Iheanachor: Hahaha, ordinary Matplotlib bro.

03/05/2020, 12:49 - Richie: Some people know the essence of this. But the skeleton in the cupboard is not letting them.... But gradually we will make them see reasons by we providing beyond reasonable doubt why its essential.... One advice to any one coming to ministries or even other company...... *stop trying to use data analysis to find thief* we are not the executive arm😂😂... Find something better... Because....

@2349079382247 raised an issue some days ago which is somewhat related
03/05/2020, 16:43 - Olayinka: What makes you a Data Scientist is not in the amount of certificates.. Right?
03/05/2020, 16:43 - Olayinka: How will what I know benefit humankind and solve problems ☹️
03/05/2020, 17:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: His logic is actually on point but it's like underfitting where he completely oversimplified the role and you will observed from most comments that's what folks are talking about the value proposition of the role and he is seeing it as a bant
03/05/2020, 18:19 - Richie: Underfitting really 😂😂😂..
So his model needs to learn better.... Na wa ohh.... Poor model
03/05/2020, 20:19 - +234 806 058 7948: A question for the bosses biko.
Does someone need to have sound understanding of statistics before taking machine learning course?

03/05/2020, 20:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Well you don't actually you can't take ML courses without a knowledge of Statistics sef but as Dumebi Okwechime said what will separate a good DS/ML guy from a bad one is a sound knowledge of Statistics which will be evident in their inferences

04/05/2020, 07:39 - +234 708 531 6273: I think "important" in that context means relevant to the industry you are working in. There is no part of analytics that is not important to a particular industry. 

If you are working in a loan company like Carbon (Paylater) . ML and NLP are the important slices . Focusing on Computer Vision and GAN is off point and not very important. 

If you are working for say a Konga or Jumia , NLP, ML, and Recommendation Engines are the few important areas . 

If you are working (or plans to work) for a company that deals with Video cameras or something, CV, GANs and the likes will be the important area

04/05/2020, 12:05 - Muhammed: 😁😁😁😁😁😁

I use to laugh at people then running form one professional course to the other during our service year
04/05/2020, 12:06 - +234 816 502 5257: "professional"?
04/05/2020, 12:06 - +234 703 344 8466: It's missing three more zeroes
04/05/2020, 12:07 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Project management is so critical that some project can't be implemented without one.

The do the keep tabs and necessary stage development.

11pm project manager still dey send email to my box when me I have shut down  

I'm just saying the fact that it's 3k doesn't mean it's scam, I could decide to make a training pro-bono but just to put some seriousness make people.pay stipend.

My opinion though, so before una finish the *Databunk*

Someone need to help the community na😂, if something too expensive we complain, now too affordable we still dey grumble
04/05/2020, 12:07 - +234 703 344 8466: PMT isn't child's play too.. The person who organised this training are the ones doing child's play
04/05/2020, 12:08 - +234 816 502 5257: Is it now like 3k?
04/05/2020, 12:09 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What do you say to AI6, DSN doing rich content training for free?
04/05/2020, 12:10 - Muhammed: I burst the burbles of one of the institutes when they came to our secretariat selling stories, they said to offer DS courses bla bla, when I approached the woman and engaged her, she asked that I meet her privately and indeed she confessed to me that they don't have the facilities I'm asking for. They only have classes on Excel 🤣, and their flier indicates ML, DL, Big Data _et al_
04/05/2020, 12:10 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 16 weeks myself @2348120919501  attended Ai6 even though I know finish, but I can say those guys rocks

16 weeks of correct lectures 

Free snacks once a while sef
04/05/2020, 12:10 - Muhammed: No be so Agbara Corpers de call am 🤣
04/05/2020, 12:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Some folks just want to help in the little way they can, and they may not have the capacity to make it completely pro-bono, so such stipends they believe can be affordable.

My take is the fact that it is cheap doesn't mean it's trash, make your research first
04/05/2020, 12:12 - Muhammed: I can't agree less with you, however, my concern is on the curriculum they'll be using
04/05/2020, 12:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That will be left to whoever is interested to conform
04/05/2020, 12:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *confirm
04/05/2020, 12:15 - Muhammed: Ai6 and DSN took you guys for complete 16 weeks right?
I'd like to know how many weeks per hour do you guys use.

Cos those "NYSC professional trainers" use 2 hours a week, take the course for 4 Saturdays, organize exams and certify those dudes afterwards
04/05/2020, 12:16 - Olayinka: The issue is not the money. At least I am organizing free classes for SQL

But the combination of the three.. In how many weeks?
04/05/2020, 12:16 - Olayinka: We are in the 4th week on the SQL class and I can't say I have taught people everything yet
04/05/2020, 12:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What if it's in track?

Where interested folks choose their tracks
04/05/2020, 12:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What if?
04/05/2020, 12:17 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The odds and the likelihood of it been true is evenly probable
04/05/2020, 12:17 - Olayinka: Yep.. That's passion.. 16 weeks is a lot bro
04/05/2020, 12:17 - Muhammed: You said it all
04/05/2020, 12:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Asin 
16 weeks for free .
Solid contents
04/05/2020, 12:18 - Olayinka: Sure.... It might not be trash

04/05/2020, 12:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Imagine if they started a Data Academy for people to be paying then mehn those guys will have blow course all these new academy that started last year were no where when they started
04/05/2020, 12:27 - Richie: Use cognitive mode in chrome... Thank me later

I will be brief as possible. 

Happy birthday @⁨Muhammad Sulaiman⁩

I met this man at nysc camp ogun, I redeployed So I clearly didn't know him from camp.

He stood out from others in the lodge with his every time gluing to his laptop. He has been nicknamed "data analyst" because he relates every discussion to Data Analysis.

LOL.. He starts every discussion with "I'm a data analyst and lemme start with this scenario".

PPA search made us close, if you ever served you will know how friends are made during this time.

He sponsored my first one week Ramadan sahur and iftar after seeing I eat out every time.

He called me one day and say why do I eat out, he has foodstuffs we can share, I didn't know how to react to this, I was like really "you want to share your food with me, you don't even know me from anywhere". It was one of the most heart-felt experience I had during the service year. If not for anything I'm indebted to him for this.

Being Muslim made us bond even more, he is a good Muslim, I can tell. At least from the side he shows me😂.

I would see him with his laptop every time and one day I asked him what do you do self, he explained to me. How he makes money and all that.

This day, I didn't even know how to create a table in excel. I went to YouTube, was glued to my laptop too. Learned hard. 

Then he told me about " introduction to analyzing and Visualizing data with excel" from Microsoft. He taught me how to apply for financial aid, lol I was even ready to pay. Thanks to him. I saved a few bucks.

He gave me my first certificate, I was really happy. Microsoft certified 😂😂😂
.. Ordinary introduction

An interviewer was wowed with this, commended me
...

He guided me through every time I needed help. He was God sent. Introduced me to this group. Never hides knowledge.

I started this journey last year October. Due to my own personal interest and his mentoring.

This is May

Today

I know power BI to a level I can teach someone

Querying with SQL at least to a level I can teach too

Querying with excel

I'm not even stopping here.... I enjoy what I do Now and even trying to dive in more.

Thanks to everyone on this group. It won't be too fair if I start to tag people. Maybe when it's their birthday, I would do same.

He tells everyone I'm a first class student and I don't want people to know. First class that can't do anything apart book. I stopped him. 😂😂

Jazakumlah khairan @⁨Muhammad Sulaiman⁩

May Allah grant you goodness in this life and the hereafter.

Amin.

05/05/2020, 22:52 - +234 816 827 7550: Good evening bosses 
I’m just starting out on my first ml project and I need some clarifications:

1. Do I split the train data from kaggleinto evaluation dataset and the true train dataset??

2. I’m I supposed to do all the data cleaning, preprocessing, featuring engineering etc on all the training, test and evaluation datasets. If yes must they be exactly the same processes I will use on all three
05/05/2020, 23:04 - +234 816 677 6236: Please is anyone working on this dataset
05/05/2020, 23:07 - +234 816 342 0137: I think you're to do all you mentioned in 2 by yourself...after the data cleaning and all, you should split your data into train and test.
05/05/2020, 23:22 - +234 816 827 7550: Thanks for responding Phemiloye.

Pls can u be more explicit 
I don’t get.

How about the evaluating dataset
06/05/2020, 02:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Got any challenge?


Though I'm not.

Good morning
06/05/2020, 02:23 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I want to assume when you say evaluation set you mean *Validation set* 

Just as @2348163420137 has said in summary;

1. Do all your preprocessing both on train and test set 

2. Split the train dataset into train, test & validation to determine your baseline model 

3. After selecting the baseline model, you then make a prediction on then initial test set you want to make predict
06/05/2020, 03:20 - +234 816 677 6236: Yes I do

06/05/2020, 06:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I'm not applying actually,I only share for anyone interested.

All scholarships are competitive but las las you go try noni and not allow the rumour of it's difficult or they don't give anyone which further increase the chances of the courageous ones who can apply.
06/05/2020, 06:17 - +234 816 062 6971: Very true. Thanks.
But this one is not rumour ooo. It is difficult 😂. It's for people like you sir.
06/05/2020, 06:21 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Scholarship dey wey no difficult?😂

You wan just chop money and you won't work for it with serious planning and hardwork? Def no

I'm sure you get what I'm saying 😂 the fact that people say or review says it's difficult shouldn't stop anyone, maybe it's the way me I see life sha "las Las the worst is we are sorry, and I have so developed shock absorber that regret mails or rejections no dey move me again because I apply with a 50/50 chance"

Also all these scholarship sef favor, luck or call it timely opportunity just play in, so not necessarily saying anyone is fit 🤟🏾

06/05/2020, 21:06 - +234 905 515 5864: So I've been in this group for over 2 months. Most of the times I'm just reading comments and admiring how smart people sound when they respond to questions with brilliant answers or when Opiano or Prince are just talking data. I'm in my final year studying accounting but I really want to know these stuffs you guys know but I didn't know where to start.  Well, 2 days ago after much procrastination and fear of finding it really difficult, I started taking a course on Power BI and I designed this with the little knowledge so far. Maybe my Data analysis journey begins here 😂
06/05/2020, 21:07 - +234 809 479 3406: Well done Peter👏🏾👏🏾. You doing well

Good job and well done 👍, we all had our 1st day of starting out, just yesterday myself & my g @2348153089036  had that discussion and here are we are today.

Just keep learning, keep making that little progress 

No pressure and don't feel overwhelmed though it's probable to feel so once a while and when you lose motivation community such as this is available to help overcome the lethargy.

Most importantly you aren't in competition with anyone but you, so let your career/learning goals drive your learning.

I'm glad you finally made the first step

*Wir lieben dich & wir sind für dich da* 🤪

08/05/2020, 10:22 - Olayinka: Let me try this using SQL too... 😁
08/05/2020, 10:24 - +234 816 502 5257: Power bi comes to mind, but I will try sql
08/05/2020, 10:25 - Olayinka: True.. But I just want to try SQL
08/05/2020, 10:26 - +234 708 531 6273: Yeah. SQL.
08/05/2020, 10:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Why PowerBI?
08/05/2020, 10:32 - Olayinka: 🤝🏾
08/05/2020, 10:32 - +234 816 502 5257: Just get insight from the data.
08/05/2020, 10:32 - +234 806 058 7948: I'm using python though
08/05/2020, 10:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This basic data extraction which is more of Exploratory 

SQL or Python is your fast go-to
08/05/2020, 10:33 - Olayinka: Some case statement coming into play. Let me clear my table and work on this
08/05/2020, 10:33 - +234 708 531 6273: Oshey . Advanced level na him my guy dey go .

Who go use Excel ?
08/05/2020, 10:34 - Olayinka: Python is cool too. Could use that too.

Is there a deadline to work on it?
08/05/2020, 10:34 - +234 806 058 7948: Lol 🤣 🤣 🤣
No be say I sabi use am o
Na practising things
08/05/2020, 10:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Excel go do am too actually
08/05/2020, 10:34 - +234 806 058 7948: No, I think it's just freestyle
08/05/2020, 10:34 - Olayinka: ✅✅✅
08/05/2020, 10:34 - +234 816 502 5257: Let's see evening. No light here
08/05/2020, 10:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If you PowerBI can then Excel can 

Just load the data as a connection not as a worksheet, so you can use the PowerPivot for easy slicing
08/05/2020, 10:37 - +27 61 290 0591: You can get in touch should you need help
08/05/2020, 10:40 - +234 806 058 7948: Thank you

08/05/2020, 12:48 - +234 806 058 7948: @2348120919501 Are you using python for this?
08/05/2020, 12:53 - Olayinka: I never even open am... But it will be SQL
08/05/2020, 13:42 - +234 818 368 5814: SQL.. Quick and clean approach
08/05/2020, 13:45 - Yusfat: Hi, what's going on

08/05/2020, 13:52 - +234 818 368 5814: 😂😂😂.. 

@2348108316393 will see to it.

Just send the account number to him
08/05/2020, 15:46 - Tosin Openiyi: @2348120919501 I think going the SQL route is a long process... Or you also intend to do the visualisation on SQL? 🤔
08/05/2020, 15:48 - Olayinka: Did dey ask for visualization boss?

I never try am ó but will check it out
08/05/2020, 15:48 - Olayinka: What's your suggestion boss.
08/05/2020, 15:57 - Tosin Openiyi: SQL is not meant for visualisation baba. There is SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for reporting and creating basic visual. But Power BI is the latest visualisation tools in town and can do and undo.

My thinking is that you will need to visualise your answers for it to standout 😁
08/05/2020, 15:57 - +234 806 840 6384: I think visualization will be needed, that's the only way others can relate
08/05/2020, 15:58 - Olayinka: We are saying the same thing in different ways 😁
08/05/2020, 15:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Well not really
08/05/2020, 15:58 - +234 806 840 6384: Power bi with the power query is my best bet
08/05/2020, 15:58 - Olayinka: I never said SQL is for visualization 😁
08/05/2020, 16:00 - +234 909 127 1976: https://twitter.com/hackSultan/status/1258772187617656838
08/05/2020, 16:01 - Tosin Openiyi: 💯
You can use write measure/ DAX formula to answer all the questions in Power BI.
08/05/2020, 16:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can work on a SQL task and make your presentation straight with PowerPoint slides to Communicate the important details which is a norm that I do regularly

However if a real time dashboard is required for continuous monitoring that's when PowerBI is opted in.

Implementing a PowerBI project is money oooo
08/05/2020, 16:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So am organization will rather ask you to get the insights out for them and present for them unless you want to do a free work of PowerBI
08/05/2020, 16:02 - +234 806 840 6384: Wawu 😁
08/05/2020, 16:02 - +234 708 531 6273: Actually I am opting for SQL because I feel it will be more tasking than BI or python. Me I am after the fulfillment of been able to do it on SQL
08/05/2020, 16:03 - Tosin Openiyi: Are you going to be doing visualisation on the PowerPoint Slide 🤔

You can as well export your visual from Power BI to Power Point or PDF
08/05/2020, 16:03 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I think you didn't get my point
08/05/2020, 16:04 - Tosin Openiyi: Get me one Power BI project na 🌚
08/05/2020, 16:05 - Tosin Openiyi: In what form will you represent those important details in the Power Point slide?
08/05/2020, 16:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What's the essence of your powerBI in that context?

To be used to report your findings right?


Can you present that findings in a well prepared PowerPoint slides without even bring PowerBI up? Yes 


Can PowerBI be exported as ppt? Yes 

What I'm saying in essence is dashboard projects are stand alone most time unless it's the regular report they share within organizations, however if it's a major project it's always alone like or  you just want to do it as added value to the client to the main project that's when you add PowerBI viz.
08/05/2020, 16:08 - Olayinka: Simple!
08/05/2020, 16:08 - Tosin Openiyi: If you want to visualise your result, you can connect your sql code to Power BI.

From Power BI, 
Get Data from SQL and use either the Import or Direct Query option.

Then you can go ahead with the visualisation.
08/05/2020, 16:09 - +234 818 368 5814: I'm observing.. 😟
08/05/2020, 16:10 - +234 806 840 6384: 👀
08/05/2020, 16:10 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So basically not all the times you just throw in PowerBI or even Python 

There are some projects you just know this one na Excel work no muscle showing
08/05/2020, 16:12 - Olayinka: I prefer to run it in SQL and if need be for visualization, one can perform integration of the two
08/05/2020, 16:13 - Tosin Openiyi: So in what format will be finding be in the Power Point slide if you ain't going be using Power BI? 🤔

If it's in a visualisation form, like bar chart, donut chart etc. What tools are you going to use? 🤔
08/05/2020, 16:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Are you kidding me 😂😂😂

Most organizations well, the last two that I've worked for have their own inbuilt ppt. template

Forget bar chat oo9
08/05/2020, 16:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You go see ppt slides you sef go love am
08/05/2020, 16:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You never see slides be that o 😂 if you think it's untill PowerBI comes in that's when you will have an awesome visualization
08/05/2020, 16:15 - Tosin Openiyi: I love sql too, it's in my DNA 🥰
08/05/2020, 16:15 - Olayinka: I know na my Oga 😎😎❣️
08/05/2020, 16:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The templates will come will lot of shapes, images and charts you can leverage on.

Don't people make presentation even without PowerBI and yet still compelling?
08/05/2020, 16:16 - Tosin Openiyi: Lols 
I have not ooooo... 🤣
Maybe person can even write code inside ppt self... Ope Oya comma educate me o
08/05/2020, 16:16 - +234 816 502 5257: Same here
08/05/2020, 16:17 - Tosin Openiyi: Nice 😁
He don dey enter small small..
08/05/2020, 16:18 - Tosin Openiyi: Like infographic template abi
08/05/2020, 16:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You don't need to write code  na 😂
08/05/2020, 16:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Exactly
08/05/2020, 16:19 - +234 708 531 6273: I am not interested in the visualisation. I can do those things on python and BI in no time. 
I want to use SQL just to see how strong my knowledge is. 

For me it's not about the visualisation.
08/05/2020, 16:19 - +234 816 502 5257: I get OpiAno... It's just a question and an answer... We are not telling a story.

The client just want numbers not how the numbers formed
08/05/2020, 16:20 - Tosin Openiyi: So you will manually key in your result abi? 🤔
08/05/2020, 16:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Exactly
08/05/2020, 16:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I can see your obsession with PowerBI😂
08/05/2020, 16:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: But really it's not all the time you dey tell story
08/05/2020, 16:20 - +234 708 531 6273: ✅✅
08/05/2020, 16:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Sometimes you just want to get information and explore and get fact out that's all
08/05/2020, 16:21 - Tosin Openiyi: Nice 😁
08/05/2020, 16:21 - +234 816 502 5257: My point exactly...
08/05/2020, 16:21 - Tosin Openiyi: Haha 😂
08/05/2020, 16:33 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Asin

No story needed 

Just tell us what is what
08/05/2020, 16:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Which I think this fall under 

Unless you just want to show muscle which is good sha to practise
08/05/2020, 16:34 - Olayinka: That's why I asked @2348110895622 if they asked for visualizations 😁..

But since it's for Learning, one can decided to take it further..
08/05/2020, 16:35 - Olayinka: This resonates so well with me
08/05/2020, 16:35 - Olayinka: Exactly... 🤣🤣
08/05/2020, 16:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No worry @2348110895622 I go disturb you well when them throw me go PowerBI project
08/05/2020, 16:40 - Tosin Openiyi: I'm at your disposal Oga mi 😁
08/05/2020, 16:44 - Tosin Openiyi: Stuff like this is sweet when you visualise your answers 😀


Please feel free to use any tools  that work best for you.

I think I should get my hands dirty with it on excel 🤔

It must not always be Power BI
08/05/2020, 16:51 - +234 806 058 7948: I will try this
08/05/2020, 16:54 - +234 806 058 7948: I did my visualization With python but I don't like the visuals. Let me try power BI
08/05/2020, 17:13 - +234 816 765 1978: 💯💯💯....you go see template, you go run. Most of the big 4's have this...
08/05/2020, 17:13 - +234 816 765 1978: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
08/05/2020, 17:23 - +234 803 381 8401: Where can I get a book on *Change management and comptia project*
08/05/2020, 17:26 - +234 803 381 8401: ?
08/05/2020, 17:44 - +234 905 362 9860: I can't agree more!🙌🏽
08/05/2020, 17:45 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You go run o😂
08/05/2020, 17:48 - +234 816 765 1978: like KPMG have their built in Excel adds in with customized charts and functionalities....Power BI is powerful, but like you said, you don't have to tell stories everytime.
08/05/2020, 18:23 - Olayinka: You want to import the csv file into PostgresSQL right?
08/05/2020, 18:23 - +234 703 469 6892: actly
08/05/2020, 18:24 - +234 703 469 6892: exactly*
08/05/2020, 18:24 - Olayinka: I have not used that query method before
08/05/2020, 18:35 - Muhammed: COPY <table name>(columns ) 
FROM 'directory\<file name>.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
08/05/2020, 18:35 - Muhammed: COPY
 <table name>(columns ) 
FROM 'directory\<file name>.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
08/05/2020, 18:35 - +234 703 469 6892: This was the method I used
08/05/2020, 18:36 - +234 703 469 6892: Thanks! I’ll try this.
08/05/2020, 18:36 - Muhammed: Created the table already? Before attempting to import the csv?
08/05/2020, 18:37 - Olayinka: Okay...
08/05/2020, 18:38 - +234 703 469 6892: Yeah I did.
With the csv header as column names
08/05/2020, 18:38 - Olayinka: If the table have been created.. Just write click on the table.
You will see import.

Open the file, click on import, change the delimiter to comma, put header on too
08/05/2020, 18:39 - Olayinka: This can help out
08/05/2020, 18:39 - +234 703 469 6892: I’ll try this later. The laptop sef don die
08/05/2020, 18:40 - Olayinka: 😁😎

09/05/2020, 19:29 - Ifeoma Chiedu: Good evening all. @2348179651769, please I need your help and the help of anyone else here who can. I need to know the process of how to download the videos of online training sites.
09/05/2020, 19:33 - +234 817 965 1769: Use IDM
09/05/2020, 19:34 - +234 817 965 1769: If udemy, the best is Udeler.


Though the MB isn't palatable
09/05/2020, 19:35 - +234 817 965 1769: But I think it's better and easy.

It will be arranged too unlike using IDM on udemy that you will do manual arrangement
09/05/2020, 19:44 - Ifeoma Chiedu: I'm still trying to wrap my head around using IDM.
09/05/2020, 19:45 - Ifeoma Chiedu: Do I need to consult someone to help me with the successful download?
09/05/2020, 19:45 - Ifeoma Chiedu: I encountered some challenges with IDM lately
09/05/2020, 19:46 - +234 905 362 9860: What learning platform are you downloading from?
09/05/2020, 19:46 - +234 703 344 8466: What sort of challenges?
09/05/2020, 19:54 - Ifeoma Chiedu: A number of them. I've got access (up to May ending) to some free courses lately and I may not internalise them all at once. I need to download and save for future reference. Do you want specific names?
09/05/2020, 19:54 - Ifeoma Chiedu: Error messages.
09/05/2020, 19:55 - Ifeoma Chiedu: Such as *you have an obsolete Google Chrome browser integration, or Google Chrome integration is not installed. Would you like to read how to fix it?*
09/05/2020, 19:56 - Ifeoma Chiedu: And *you have 23 days left to use internet download manager. Do you want to register your copy of IDM now?*
09/05/2020, 19:56 - +234 703 344 8466: On PC idm should work just fine. Although you are responsible for organising what you download. I do most of my downloads on Coursera where you won't even need idm.
09/05/2020, 19:57 - +234 703 344 8466: Oh you need to get the patch

11/05/2020, 05:19 - Muhammed: Thanks to the peer learning group, got to know that the model *is not doing well* 😁🤣
11/05/2020, 05:40 - +234 806 058 7948: You did not assume the away goal advantage
11/05/2020, 08:42 - Olayinka: Yes.. I have not considered that last part well..
11/05/2020, 08:43 - Olayinka: But by away goal.. Does that mean that

If Brazil has 6 and England has 5


Does that mean that England won?

Is that what away goaal mean?
11/05/2020, 08:53 - +234 816 631 6330: I think away go is only applicable in uefa while head do head is been used in other tournament
11/05/2020, 08:54 - Olayinka: That's what I know... It's in UEFA that away goal applies..
11/05/2020, 08:54 - Olayinka: @2348060587948 what's the away goal about here?
11/05/2020, 08:54 - +234 816 631 6330: There's nothing first leg and the second leg in world cup.
11/05/2020, 08:56 - +234 806 058 7948: You guys are not getting. Applying that rule in the analysis has nothing to do with the body governing the tournament. I think he just wanted to see if we can create a new column showing that.
My opinion
11/05/2020, 08:57 - +234 816 631 6330: Exactly, I think this term should be defined
11/05/2020, 08:57 - Olayinka: So what's the away goal advantage here?
11/05/2020, 08:58 - +234 806 058 7948: By away goal, if Brazil has 6 and England has 5, Brazil wins. But wherever there is 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, the away team wins
11/05/2020, 08:59 - +234 806 058 7948: Meaning that only goalless matches should be draw
11/05/2020, 09:05 - +234 806 058 7948: Copy that @2348120919501 ?
11/05/2020, 09:09 - Olayinka: OK..
11/05/2020, 09:09 - Olayinka: That's not a problem

11/05/2020, 12:57 - Muhammed: I'm not a fan of football and don't understand anything about football 😁, that's why I'm not joining you guys ó, so I won't be analyzing nonsense 🤣😂
11/05/2020, 13:00 - +234 817 965 1769: Honestly I am not a fan too.


In fact, I worst.

I just picked for data cleaning and transforming. But the data is cleaned
11/05/2020, 13:00 - +234 817 965 1769: Is the date meant to be object or int?
11/05/2020, 13:01 - Muhammed: Toor, how do I start analyzing something I don't know about 🤣
11/05/2020, 13:01 - +234 817 965 1769: But I can still do somethings.
11/05/2020, 13:03 - +234 817 965 1769: No laugh ooo.

I assumed away team + home team makes a match.


So I created a new column.

Home goal + away goal = fill score in a match.


I grouped the year and count to know number of match per year
11/05/2020, 13:04 - Muhammed: 👍

HRs are getting smarter and beating ATS also

Me that went for my Deloitte Assessment Centre last year and I was sha gisting with some applicants and then the conversation led me to say that I was here for the test the previous month and everyone starting looking at me. They said they all did their test last year and that they already lost hope. I felt very lucky.
12/05/2020, 22:49 - +234 816 062 6971: They didn't get any response until a year after
12/05/2020, 22:51 - Mayokun: Big fours application can be so long and annoying
12/05/2020, 22:51 - Mayokun: I think the best time to apply is probably when you just start your service😂
12/05/2020, 22:53 - +234 816 062 6971: Yes. Exactly. I finished the whole process in less than a month I guess but couldn't resume. I just started service then.
12/05/2020, 22:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You were an outlier actually
And as boss na 

You were a talent that needed to be hunted fast before someone else carry you away

12/05/2020, 22:56 - Mayokun: Deloitte and KPMG keeps recruiting people

People keep writing test and then there’s no definite time or assurance of when you’ll resume
12/05/2020, 22:56 - Mayokun: I concur
12/05/2020, 22:56 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: We are saying same thing 😂😂

Lucky it was from your end, but talent hunting from the recruiters perspective when you killed them at the interview stage 

Guess what? The HR that recruited you will have a great KPI review from the boss for hunting such a talent 😂
12/05/2020, 22:56 - +234 816 062 6971: Very true.

12/05/2020, 22:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: About the last part, no jokes I'm actually serious, I got the information actually

You get a good talent and correct performer you don make KPI be that as HR person

14/05/2020, 19:52 - +234 818 368 5814: Hello Data Enthusiast, 

Without a doubt, data visualization is a crucial tool in today’s data-focused business world.

Data visualization doesn’t just show patterns and trends. It also brings important but subtle correlations and relationships between business conditions into focus.

The ability of anyone on the Data Science career path to use SQL for data extraction into the preferred data visualization tool is a great weapon to include in your arsenal. 

From the graph below, it can be depicted that company XYZ has less than 20,000 workers as at 1990 and after 12 years (2002),company XYZ has more than 40,000 workers. 

However, the ratio in number of workers throughout the year between male and female has been a constant ratio of 60% male and 40% female. 

What can you inferred from the graph. 


Thank you

15/05/2020, 03:04 - +234 818 368 5814: The one that is working
15/05/2020, 03:08 - Tosin Openiyi: 1. Use line, bar, pie or donut chart. If you are using Power BI for the visualisation, make sure that the x-axis is set to "categorical".

2. Try Bubble chart or scatter plot
15/05/2020, 03:10 - +234 818 368 5814: Solved.. 


It's ordinary comma that has been giving me headache
15/05/2020, 03:11 - Tosin Openiyi: Lols 🤣
You see the advantage of clean code 😁
15/05/2020, 03:11 - +234 818 368 5814: The comma in front of "join " and "order"
15/05/2020, 03:11 - +234 818 368 5814: I just packed it up liadat o since it was given error for easy screenshot.
15/05/2020, 03:12 - +234 809 828 1153: 😅
15/05/2020, 03:13 - Tosin Openiyi: Okay Boss 😁
Na you know wetin you want to achieve with the code. Thank God it's working now 😁
Enjoy!
15/05/2020, 03:14 - +234 818 368 5814: Thank you and @2348098281153
15/05/2020, 03:53 - +234 818 368 5814: DELIMETER is always seen as incorrect syntax @2348110895622 @2348098281153
15/05/2020, 03:54 - Tosin Openiyi: Is this another error message or your conclusion?
15/05/2020, 03:55 - +234 818 368 5814: Error message
15/05/2020, 03:58 - +234 809 828 1153: Try Delimiter instead
15/05/2020, 04:00 - Tosin Openiyi: Do you put full stop to the previous code (;)?
15/05/2020, 04:04 - Tosin Openiyi: Also ensure you reset the delimiter to default.

Syntax is 👇🏿

```DELIMITER $$
 CREATE procedure
 END $$
```DELIMITER ;
15/05/2020, 04:07 - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks Tosin
15/05/2020, 04:19 - +234 818 368 5814: Yes..
15/05/2020, 04:19 - +234 818 368 5814: The reset is not working... 

It's underlined
15/05/2020, 04:19 - +234 818 368 5814: Yes
15/05/2020, 04:20 - +234 812 216 8133: What the categories are greater than say 300.
15/05/2020, 04:28 - +234 810 878 6913: Nai so the tinz just be ooo
15/05/2020, 04:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks
15/05/2020, 04:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Why this error? I'm trying to import CSV file?
15/05/2020, 07:15 - Tosin Openiyi: You are using the delimiter because you want to create store procedure?
15/05/2020, 07:18 - Tosin Openiyi: Your spelling is wrong Bro...
It is Delimiter not Delimeter 😊
15/05/2020, 07:44 - +234 708 044 2114: 🤣🤣🤣🤣

15/05/2020, 14:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Hey guys 

Anyone familiar with Qlikview ?


Check in with me there is an opening with Lafarge for a Sales Analyst role with emphasis on *Qlikview* along side Excel & PowerBi
15/05/2020, 14:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Please not I just started learning or I can interact with the platform
15/05/2020, 15:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It starts this evening for the whole weekend.

Incase anyone is interested in teaming up for the *Article recommender* use case
15/05/2020, 15:24 - Richie: Ehhh i if you know excel and PowerBI... Use this night learn Qlikview😌
15/05/2020, 15:29 - Tosin Openiyi: Go Ope, go for the gold 🥇
15/05/2020, 15:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Inside life 🥴
15/05/2020, 15:40 - +234 816 502 5257: Lol..
15/05/2020, 16:04 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol.
It depends on salary and the current role of that person.
15/05/2020, 16:05 - +234 817 965 1769: I think our discussion here sometimes ago that some companies don't just want you to do the job, but do it with a particular software or language
15/05/2020, 17:54 - Tosin Openiyi: You did not Begin Transaction 😊
15/05/2020, 17:56 - +234 809 828 1153: How do you mean?
15/05/2020, 18:02 - Tosin Openiyi: If I'm understanding, you are using rollback because you want to be able to recover the deleted records.
15/05/2020, 18:05 - +234 809 828 1153: Yes
15/05/2020, 18:06 - Tosin Openiyi: Let do some quick troubleshout..... Remove the ; from rollback and try again
15/05/2020, 18:09 - +234 803 420 2314: Did  you COMMIT at a  certain point before using  it?
15/05/2020, 18:10 - +234 809 828 1153: Okay
15/05/2020, 18:10 - +234 809 828 1153: I did
15/05/2020, 18:12 - +234 803 420 2314: Because what a learner and novice like me know is, rollback takes you to the last comimited point. More like a 'restore point' in systems
15/05/2020, 18:12 - +234 803 420 2314: Have you tried what the boss requested?
15/05/2020, 18:23 - +234 809 828 1153: It’s still the same thing
15/05/2020, 18:23 - +234 809 828 1153: Just did it’s still the same
15/05/2020, 18:26 - +234 817 965 1769: Nawa ooo.


This group is now becoming SQL base nowadays ooo.


You guys are intimidating olodo like me
15/05/2020, 18:27 - Tosin Openiyi: Try this 👇🏿

```BEGIN TRANSACTION
(your codes)
ROLLBACK```
15/05/2020, 18:39 - +234 809 828 1153: Still the same
15/05/2020, 18:41 - Tosin Openiyi: Which of the SQL are you using MYSQL/SQLLITE/POSTGRESQL/MS SQL?
15/05/2020, 18:42 - +234 803 420 2314: Drop or truncate and start again jare 😁
15/05/2020, 18:42 - +234 809 828 1153: MYSQL
15/05/2020, 18:43 - +234 809 828 1153: Chai
Okay😅
15/05/2020, 18:44 - +234 803 420 2314: Since all them bosses solution did not work for u na
15/05/2020, 18:45 - Tosin Openiyi: In my SQL, START TRANSACTION AND SAVE POINT is used not BEGIN TRANSACTION..... Try this. read more here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2356566/how-can-i-roll-back-my-last-delete-command-in-mysql
15/05/2020, 18:46 - +234 809 828 1153: Okay
Thank you
15/05/2020, 18:46 - +234 809 828 1153: Lol
Thank you
15/05/2020, 18:46 - Tosin Openiyi: START TRANSACTION;
SAVE POINT A01;
(DELETE STATEMENT);
ROLLBACK TO A01;
15/05/2020, 19:01 - +234 809 828 1153: It workeddddd
15/05/2020, 19:02 - +234 809 828 1153: Thank you @2348110895622
15/05/2020, 19:02 - Tosin Openiyi: 🤗
15/05/2020, 19:26 - +234 810 878 6913: Didn't worry, we will turn it to power BI very soon
15/05/2020, 22:24 - +234 803 420 2314: Is this the exact title?
15/05/2020, 22:26 - +234 706 297 4329: Check z library
15/05/2020, 22:26 - +234 706 297 4329: You may find it there
15/05/2020, 22:30 - +234 803 420 2314: What I see in my library is, 'data structures and algorithm' by same author
16/05/2020, 00:39 - +234 816 342 0137: Yes
16/05/2020, 00:39 - +234 816 342 0137: Can you share it please?
16/05/2020, 10:32 - Muhammed: Spot on
16/05/2020, 10:44 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂 so what would make one be a Data Scientist?
16/05/2020, 10:45 - Muhammed: Hands-on practice, practice and practice
16/05/2020, 10:46 - +234 813 780 3722: 👌🏿
16/05/2020, 10:47 - +234 810 878 6913: How can one undergo online class without practicing?
16/05/2020, 10:47 - +234 810 878 6913: That one never ready to become data scientist na
16/05/2020, 10:48 - Muhammed: Online courses will introduce you to the basics, but if you want in-depth knowledge, you got to move out of your comfort zones
16/05/2020, 10:48 - +234 818 368 5814: Pls I need free git course on udacity. 

I've been searching for it but couldn't find it
16/05/2020, 10:49 - +234 810 878 6913: Well Said. Thanks
16/05/2020, 11:43 - +234 813 482 8979: Please i need help finding unique values of a list i tried converting to set then back to list but there are still some hidden duplicates i think

16/05/2020, 11:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's the property of set 

There can't be duplicate unless the datatypes are different
16/05/2020, 11:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So set will see numeric 1 different from string 1

1 & '1' will be different
16/05/2020, 12:06 - +234 813 482 8979: I guess this is where the issue is..so how do i get the unique values
16/05/2020, 12:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can use a list comprehension and covert each to string and use the set
16/05/2020, 12:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: set([str(i) for i in the lst])

Where lst is the name of the initial  lst
16/05/2020, 12:17 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *initial list
16/05/2020, 12:55 - +234 813 482 8979: Thanks boss

16/05/2020, 14:49 - Muhammed: 😅😂
16/05/2020, 14:49 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Statistic, Mathematics and Predictive Analytics as not useful yet Data science as very useful and not difficult to acquire

Abeg what is Data Science? Data visualization😂
16/05/2020, 14:50 - Muhammed: Those guys are comp
completely confused 🤣
16/05/2020, 14:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Aswear
16/05/2020, 14:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: AI as very useful yet Data Warehousing as not useful 

Can you do AI without a strong and great data architecture
16/05/2020, 14:53 - Muhammed: Are you sure that HBR is really Havard Business Review or some Hogwash Business Review 🤣😅
16/05/2020, 14:53 - +234 813 730 6439: 🤣🤣🤣
16/05/2020, 14:53 - +234 802 825 9007: Exactly! Ignore mathematics and Statistics?🤡
16/05/2020, 14:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: My guy 


Na so I see am o😂😂😂
16/05/2020, 14:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What then is Data Science
Maybe Data Visualization sha
16/05/2020, 14:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂
16/05/2020, 14:54 - +234 802 825 9007: Then there's no data analysis or data science
16/05/2020, 14:54 - +234 802 825 9007: As in
16/05/2020, 14:55 - +234 813 730 6439: It looks more like a confusion matrix....
16/05/2020, 14:56 - +234 813 730 6439: I'm sure it was done on purpose
16/05/2020, 14:56 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: When I saw it I was just laughing say HBR fall our hand this time around 

Hope we have not been scammed by that Harvard Business Review that "Data science is the sexiest job in the 21st century"
16/05/2020, 14:56 - Muhammed: 🤔
16/05/2020, 14:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Abeg o

Hope we have not been misled 😂
16/05/2020, 14:57 - Muhammed: 😅😂🤣
16/05/2020, 14:58 - Muhammed: This is deep 🤔
16/05/2020, 14:58 - Muhammed: Let them tell us on time ó, so we can transition 😅🤣
16/05/2020, 14:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Asin 

Confusion matrix that's really confusing
16/05/2020, 15:05 - +234 802 825 9007: 😂😂🔥
16/05/2020, 15:17 - +234 813 730 6439: 🤣🤣🤣
16/05/2020, 15:17 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I hope we are safe
16/05/2020, 15:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Data visualization segment is correct because it's very easy to learn in a short time - 2 month with real project and pressure you go learn am, but most of the others them no try with the classification
16/05/2020, 15:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: But they want you to learn Data science and ignore Math & stat 😂
16/05/2020, 15:21 - Muhammed: Best of luck to their target audience 🤣😅
16/05/2020, 15:23 - +234 817 965 1769: 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
16/05/2020, 15:24 - +234 817 965 1769: Abi they beg one person in Nigeria to do it for them
16/05/2020, 15:24 - +234 817 965 1769: Abi the sold the name, HBR out. Something must be wrong
16/05/2020, 15:25 - +234 818 534 6200: I agree with you.
Something must be wrong.
HBR would not bring out this crap.
16/05/2020, 15:27 - Muhammed: Probably they'll have a better explanation for what they meant in that image, but until then, they've fallen our hands already 😓
16/05/2020, 15:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: https://hbr.org/2018/10/prioritize-which-data-skills-your-company-needs-with-this-2x2-matrix
16/05/2020, 15:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂
16/05/2020, 15:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You don't need *Data Cleaning* for now just browse through it 

How will your Data Science survive without this 😂
16/05/2020, 15:31 - Muhammed: They said this in 2018 now 🤣. Maybe they never understood Data Science then 😅🥴
16/05/2020, 16:37 - +234 810 878 6913: Transit to where if I may ask? 😂😂😂
16/05/2020, 16:40 - Muhammed: Anywhere trending. Always be prepared to transition
16/05/2020, 16:46 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm
Okay boss
16/05/2020, 16:46 - +234 810 878 6913: But if I may ask, are we transiting because of the pay or what?
16/05/2020, 16:47 - Muhammed: Not really, the IT/DS world is dynamic and not static, hence, you must be prepared to move with time.
16/05/2020, 16:49 - Muhammed: A few years ago, *Big Data* was almost unknown to Data professionals, however, in recent years, it has gained ground and we're all (maybe not everyone really) getting ourselves inclined to it
16/05/2020, 16:50 - Muhammed: IoT amongst others are fields Data Scientists and other DevOps are are transitioning to.
16/05/2020, 16:51 - Muhammed: I hope I am able to answer your questions minimally
16/05/2020, 16:53 - +234 703 344 8466: Are you saying that DS will soon be obscure or give way for more in demand skills in the near future?
16/05/2020, 16:54 - +234 810 878 6913: A little bit
16/05/2020, 16:54 - +234 810 878 6913: I think that's what he's saying🤔🤔🤔
16/05/2020, 16:54 - Muhammed: Nope don't get me wrong, IoT encompasses Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Cybernetics, amongst others, hence you might be interested in exploring them
16/05/2020, 16:55 - +234 703 344 8466: Oh alright
16/05/2020, 16:55 - Muhammed: 😅🤣, don't quote me out of context please 🙏
16/05/2020, 16:55 - +234 810 878 6913: Oh I get it now
16/05/2020, 16:55 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂 sorry
16/05/2020, 16:56 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Because of the bag
16/05/2020, 16:56 - +234 703 344 8466: Shikena😄
16/05/2020, 16:56 - Muhammed: Just giving you instances you can transition to using your existing knowledge of DS
16/05/2020, 16:57 - Muhammed: 🙌🙌🙌😅
16/05/2020, 16:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No time 

If typewriting is the future we will drop anything and dive in 

Me I no like IT or anything, I just want to be relevant to secure the bag 

Lobatan
16/05/2020, 16:58 - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly! You have said it all 😂😂😂😂
16/05/2020, 16:58 - +234 810 878 6913: Abi ooo😂😂
16/05/2020, 16:58 - Muhammed: It may surprise you that majority of what you are doing locally can be done on cloud easily and within a little time.

Automation has come to stay
16/05/2020, 16:59 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmmm... But you could have secured the bag with your BEng degree in electrical, or don't you think so? 🤔🤔🤔
16/05/2020, 16:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No in Nigeria my guy 

Ko jawo
16/05/2020, 17:00 - Muhammed: Some of us like IT, but the bag is importanter 😂😅
16/05/2020, 17:00 - +234 810 878 6913: Says who?
16/05/2020, 17:00 - +234 810 878 6913: Word
16/05/2020, 17:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Says someone who understand the Engineering space
16/05/2020, 17:00 - +234 703 344 8466: True
16/05/2020, 17:00 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂
16/05/2020, 17:01 - +234 703 344 8466: Truer words have never been said🙇🏽‍♂️🙇🏽‍♂️🙇🏽‍♂️
16/05/2020, 17:01 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm... I doubt Sha
16/05/2020, 17:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You may want to tell me Oil company

And I will also you how many engineering graduate get employed every year into the sector as entry level?
16/05/2020, 17:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Drop your point let's discuss
16/05/2020, 17:02 - Muhammed: You really can't come into big data without having a working knowledge of cloud computing (speaking from experience). Google Query, Big Table, AutoML _et al_
16/05/2020, 17:02 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay let's discuss...
16/05/2020, 17:03 - Muhammed: Na true now 🤣
16/05/2020, 17:03 - +234 703 344 8466: And for those you must know sql
16/05/2020, 17:04 - Muhammed: Before ńkọ́ 🌝
16/05/2020, 17:06 - +234 703 344 8466: Every passing things get more complex.. More things to do, more things to learn 😖
16/05/2020, 17:07 - +234 810 878 6913: I believe you as an engineer you can be doing some design job from friends, colleagues through referral thereabout, in addition to you normal job. Let's say you're working for company A as their design engineer or instrumentation engineer, I can as well give you some side jobs from my company (let's say I have a contract)

But in Data science, I think you're only restricted to the trunk of database of your company. You can barely get jobs outside your place of work... This is my point, perhaps I might be wrong @2348108522573
16/05/2020, 17:07 - +234 810 878 6913: No doubt
16/05/2020, 17:10 - +234 810 878 6913: That's SQL oo
16/05/2020, 17:10 - Muhammed: 👍
16/05/2020, 17:11 - +234 810 878 6913: Pls where can I download dataset to work with on SQL... I need to sharpen my SQL skill that @2348120919501 has taught us
16/05/2020, 17:51 - +234 803 381 8401: 🙌🏿🙌🏿
16/05/2020, 17:51 - +234 810 878 6913: Sup
16/05/2020, 17:52 - +234 803 381 8401: Sup bro?
16/05/2020, 17:53 - +234 803 381 8401: @2348120919501  thanks so much.🙏🏿


Hopefully we'll see tableau training too very soon 😉
16/05/2020, 17:54 - +234 810 878 6913: Tableau or power BI?😂😂
16/05/2020, 17:54 - +234 810 878 6913: Cool n you?
16/05/2020, 18:42 - +234 803 381 8401: Tableau pls
16/05/2020, 18:43 - Muhammed: @2347030343362 Should take us on that
16/05/2020, 19:07 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. Let him tell us on Tableau while @2348120919501 should take us on Power BI...

I'm really loving this family💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽
16/05/2020, 19:14 - Olayinka: 😁😁
16/05/2020, 19:16 - +234 816 170 8710: @2348108522573 Please one of my guy wanna join the group, can I send his details for him to fill the final slot🙏🏼
16/05/2020, 19:17 - Muhammed: Group is full already
16/05/2020, 19:17 - +234 810 878 6913: You're so amazing
16/05/2020, 19:18 - +234 810 878 6913: Take*

Let's see.. We could even do R
16/05/2020, 19:20 - +234 816 170 8710: Remain a slot I guess,  257 is the max but currently 256 members
16/05/2020, 19:20 - Olayinka: On Tableau tight?
16/05/2020, 19:20 - Olayinka: right*
16/05/2020, 19:20 - Olayinka: Thanks brother
16/05/2020, 19:20 - +234 803 381 8401: 💪🏿💪🏿
16/05/2020, 19:21 - +234 803 381 8401: I remember some1 left
16/05/2020, 19:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This is a joke 😂

Talking as an experience hire or entry level fresh graduate?
16/05/2020, 19:23 - +234 813 780 3722: Someone else joined
16/05/2020, 19:25 - +234 803 381 8401: Ah,ok
16/05/2020, 19:27 - +234 708 531 6273: No mind them. If not for big 4 and banks we engineering grads for here weeeen! 

Engineering is rewarding if you get into oil and gas but how many oil and gas companies dey recruit now ?  Even when they recruit sef how many do they take in ?
16/05/2020, 19:28 - +234 810 878 6913: Ah! R? I never sabi python finish ooo😂😂😂
16/05/2020, 19:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Don't mind him 😂

That's what I'm trying to paint for him that *Kojawo* in Nigeria for entry row reason Engineering graduate have to dive into other fields 

But Engineering is sweet at the Managerial level and that's the plan 😂😂
16/05/2020, 19:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Hahahaha... Both😂😂
16/05/2020, 19:31 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. I'm taking from my field Sha. As a Structural Engineer graduate, I blv what I said is achievable. My colleagues are doing really big
16/05/2020, 19:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Oil & gas recruit once in a blue moon and it's like 1% or less sef for each tenure they recruit 

What the ratio compared to the number of graduate churned out yearly
16/05/2020, 19:32 - +234 708 531 6273: I studied engineering for 5 years still I can't be called an engineer until I write coren exams after practising for another 5 years at least. 
 By then someone that studied Computer science go don buy house for lekki . Lmao
16/05/2020, 19:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Baba 

Even with your field 😂
16/05/2020, 19:33 - +234 708 531 6273: Yeah but the intake is too too low . I studied Civil engineering too but since I graduated I never see any graduate trainee role for civil engineering
16/05/2020, 19:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Who go give you contract as a fresh grad?

Na shell wan give you contract or Schlumberger
16/05/2020, 19:35 - +234 708 531 6273: Apart from oil and gas that takes almost all engineering grads
16/05/2020, 19:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Aswear 

And without the name Engr you can't get the contract you are talking about because you don't have the credibility which is why you go for entry level as the sure option 

How many entry level dey 

All thanks to Banks, Big4 and other firms saving the lives of Engineering grad
16/05/2020, 19:36 - +234 810 878 6913: But you can be doing other job from friends and colleagues
16/05/2020, 19:36 - +234 810 878 6913: I doubt bros
16/05/2020, 19:37 - +234 810 878 6913: Colleague can give u a 2 storey building contract to supervise... I know what I'm saying sha
16/05/2020, 19:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Mention how many graduate trainee role for Civil Engineering graduate


Julius Berger?
16/05/2020, 19:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂
16/05/2020, 19:38 - +234 810 878 6913: Indigenous company nko?
16/05/2020, 19:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Guy you are a data analyst you don't use 1 sample to make a general conclusion

You are an outlier because that's not the norm
16/05/2020, 19:38 - +234 810 878 6913: Companies*
16/05/2020, 19:39 - +234 810 878 6913: Baba dn use data science justify wetin I talk ooo
16/05/2020, 19:39 - +234 810 878 6913: I understand you sha

16/05/2020, 19:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Mention them and say with emphasis when they recruit
16/05/2020, 19:40 - +234 810 878 6913: I can't think of any na... But I know I have been seeing some openings on entry level for civil engineering graduates
16/05/2020, 19:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Civil engineering 

My field sef get hope pass Civil yet kojawo   😂
16/05/2020, 19:42 - +234 810 878 6913: Electrical?

I get this questions steady 


I will tell them "I did my internship in an oil and gas, well yes the money is there but the passion wasn't really them, so I found my passion here"

Let's Bobo ourselves

Let's celebrate the great Profession 

Forget say Nigeria no allow our glory shine
16/05/2020, 20:15 - +234 703 469 6892: E easy for you as an electrical grad. You practically fit into most industry somehow. With P.E degree u say your passion no Dey oil and gas 🤣🤣
16/05/2020, 20:15 - Muhammed: Back in school, those lecturers will tell you all form of things that your course is the best, only to realize that you have been scammed upon graduation 🤣🤣
16/05/2020, 20:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Actually na true oo 😅😅😂

16/05/2020, 20:31 - +234 708 531 6273: The truth is everything na training. No one came from heaven with additional skills. But have your degree in those courses will give you enough flexibility. You can do well in investment banking, Analytics, software development and all. Na training
16/05/2020, 20:32 - +234 806 840 6384: Exactly
16/05/2020, 20:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If you are going for regular Interviews as an engineering student you gas have a rebuttal to these kind questions

I have a standby response, well crafted and internalize 😂

16/05/2020, 22:47 - Muhammed: Why did not go for tailoring rather than spend 4/5 years in the university?
16/05/2020, 22:48 - Muhammed: When they could have established themselves within those years?
16/05/2020, 22:49 - +234 810 878 6913: The knowledge gotten from the University would make me Know hot to run my business well than someone that didn't go at all

16/05/2020, 22:49 - Muhammed: I won't argue with you, however, some courses thrive in some countries better than some other courses.

16/05/2020, 22:53 - Muhammed: EBS => Entrepreneurship and Business Studies
16/05/2020, 22:55 - Muhammed: Same reason they'll tell you that psychiatric nursing is a hot cake in the US and you see many students rushing to study it, only to discover that getting visa alone is harder than the 5 years they spent in the nursing school
16/05/2020, 22:55 - +234 810 878 6913: Didn't they offer entrepreneurship course in their penultimate year?
16/05/2020, 22:58 - Muhammed: Entrepreneurship? Don't be deceived by SMART and SWOT taught in your penultimate year in school ó, you can't expect to take a course in entrepreneurship within a semester and boom, you're an entrepreneur
16/05/2020, 22:59 - Muhammed: This message was deleted
16/05/2020, 23:00 - Muhammed: It's like you learning *print("Hello world!")* and adding Python Programming to your resume/cv
16/05/2020, 23:02 - +234 813 838 3315: Well, most of us lack purpose as at that time.
And there wasn't a Mentor ( per say ) to guide us through.
16/05/2020, 23:03 - Muhammed: Same way they'll tell you that Yoruba is a selling course in the US, are they teaching STEM with Yoruba? Even AIMS requires that you are either trained in English Language or have passed the English proficiency exams
16/05/2020, 23:03 - Muhammed: You're right about this 👆, majority either had a wrong mentor or had none
16/05/2020, 23:06 - +234 810 878 6913: I never had a mentor😭😭
16/05/2020, 23:08 - Muhammed: Having a mentor is one thing, having the right mentor is another thing
16/05/2020, 23:09 - Muhammed: Sometimes, your mentor will want to shape you to fit into his life, which might be a wrong decision for you
16/05/2020, 23:09 - +234 810 878 6913: True Sha... I just need to work on myself
16/05/2020, 23:09 - +234 810 878 6913: What if you both have the same career goal?
16/05/2020, 23:10 - Muhammed: That's a good one, but it doesn't work out like this most of the time
16/05/2020, 23:10 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmm
16/05/2020, 23:11 - Muhammed: My grand mentor in my IT career is my big brother. We studied the same course in the university, but had different passions. The only thing that joins us together is that we both are die hard fans of cloud 🌥
16/05/2020, 23:12 - +234 810 878 6913: You're still into cloud?

19/05/2020, 13:41 - Muhammed: *Ethics and Law in Business & Analytics* is an important aspect to always pay attention to. Don't be derived by your analytical skills or visualization skills to violate or breach ethics or protocols.

*Not all data are meant to be thrown to the public*
19/05/2020, 13:42 - Muhammed: Drived*
19/05/2020, 13:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I don't think it was a Data privacy issue though
19/05/2020, 13:54 - Muhammed: Read through, she was told to censor some data according to her
19/05/2020, 13:55 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I think it's an ethical concern
19/05/2020, 13:56 - Muhammed: I cited *Ethics and Law in Business and Analytics*
19/05/2020, 13:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The principles of ethics in data and AI are;.
1. Equality
2. Trust
3. Character Value 
4. Non suffering 
5. Autonomous

The trust is what get broken when she was requested to censor information which she wasn't ready to do which makes her an ethical person.

Her been ethical put her job on the line
19/05/2020, 13:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That was why this guy asked the question


Would you stand up for data ethics if your job was on the line?
19/05/2020, 13:58 - Muhammed: Yeah, trust is one of the elements of *ethics*, while I understand that she did not want to be compromised, I believe she was prepared for what's to come afterwards
19/05/2020, 13:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: She didn't break the ethic codes, she was only punished for doing the right thing
19/05/2020, 14:00 - Muhammed: I agree with you, but we're all answerable to some authorities, which is meant to be respected. She going against the authorities is what led to her removal
19/05/2020, 14:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Data privacy breach you spotted here was what I rebutted that it's not a data breached issue but ethical 

So she didn't do anything wrong, but only punished for been ethical
19/05/2020, 14:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No 

We are answerable to what is right 

So will you do the wrong thing because your superior asked you to?


That's the subject of discussion the author of the above post you shared initiated
19/05/2020, 14:03 - Muhammed: Mind you, the *breaching* aspect of my write-up here is just an advice or a gesture from my end that, we should follow due procedures or laid down rules.
19/05/2020, 14:03 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's like saying *NCDC* should  asked to doctor the dashboard you created for them imagine it get adopted 


What will you do knowing your job is on the line ?

That the question not that she breached data privacy
19/05/2020, 14:04 - Muhammed: She could have applied maturity by stepping down the dashboarding while they iron things out
19/05/2020, 14:04 - Muhammed: Just me thinking out sha
19/05/2020, 14:05 - Muhammed: I'd rather not proceed with the dashboard, it'll be a win-win for both parties
19/05/2020, 14:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Well you aren't her 

Maybe that's how you will respond to it if you were in her shoe!


So it boils down to the question;

Will you uphold the principles of ethics in AI no matter the circumstances? I think that's a rhetorical question
19/05/2020, 14:06 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can say yes, but trust me we know this thing as e dey go😂

Let's just pray not to be in such corners and if found  God help you to handle it well
19/05/2020, 14:06 - Muhammed: Yeah, I'm voicing out my opinion which is subject to change from that of another person
19/05/2020, 14:07 - Muhammed: Amen ó 🤲
19/05/2020, 14:07 - Muhammed: That's the best prayer
19/05/2020, 14:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Btw

19/05/2020, 20:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Just wrap the formula in that column in an *IFERROR (original formula, 0)*
19/05/2020, 20:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That means when error occur return 0
19/05/2020, 21:02 - +234 816 677 6236: But if I use the IFERROR, It would return 0,not the value it should be. The column was gotten by multiplying two other columns in the data
19/05/2020, 21:03 - +234 816 677 6236: Do you think I should still go ahead using the if error
19/05/2020, 21:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: IFERROR is to help you handle error encountered, it's a data cleaning function in excel, so it won't affect it
19/05/2020, 21:05 - +234 816 677 6236: Thank you much
19/05/2020, 21:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You will get the value if no error but when error is encountered instead of getting an error you get 0
19/05/2020, 21:05 - +234 816 677 6236: Thank you
19/05/2020, 21:13 - +234 816 677 6236: Done
19/05/2020, 21:13 - +234 816 677 6236: Thanks
19/05/2020, 21:37 - Tosin Openiyi: Thanks Baba, this can also be achieved in Power Query with the  *Replace Error...* function. Once you right click on the affected column, select *Replace Error...* and type "null" in the value field of the resulting dialog box.

20/05/2020, 18:55 - +234 808 325 6441: For bottom you can use order by desc limit 5 also

Boss ways of asking the right questions, we the SQL Server user can't relate with LIMIT

LIMIT that embarrassed me my first job using SQL Server na so so error e dey throw, I was confused
20/05/2020, 19:11 - +234 816 631 6330: 😕
20/05/2020, 19:11 - Yusfat: U wrote *custom* ... But my over-sharp eye  transmitted something different to my shallow brain
20/05/2020, 19:16 - +234 816 631 6330: Hmmm..... Share it please
20/05/2020, 19:16 - Tosin Openiyi: Lols 🤣 I have been there too.  The same way MySQL did not recognise ```BEGIN TRANSACTION``` but no shaking sha, once person understand SQL code, you can transfer the knowledge from MYSQL to MS SQL to POSTGRES and SQLITE. Even ORACLE SQL self won't be difficult to relate with.
20/05/2020, 19:17 - +234 816 631 6330: 📌
20/05/2020, 19:18 - Yusfat: Let me flow with d group discussion instead. They understand me already
20/05/2020, 19:21 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yeah 

Standard SQL as it is called which is common to them all.

We had a training with a client one time na so my boss called me the evening before "Ope can you please prepare as a backup to take ORACLE with the client tomorrow during our pitch because that's the db they use" 

Mehn fear owe me o😂😂😂, I no sleep that night only for her to call me next morning "Thanks Ope they said they are fine, so don't worry 😌"

I use the opportunity learn Oracle sha


Pressure is the fastest way to learn 😂😂

So timely boss. But sometimes we gotta apply constructive discontent i.e been grrateful to God and also believe we can do more than one's current status.

Just a perception.
20/05/2020, 21:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The author of the post I'm sure wouldn't discredit self development and making effort, but on focus on pressure the external you can't control places on you
20/05/2020, 21:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So instead of getting overwhelmed, just make your little progress at your pace and at the right time things will fall in place because you sure can't have control over somethings
20/05/2020, 21:43 - +234 703 344 8466: LinkedIn that can intimidate person 😢😆

20/05/2020, 22:19 - +234 816 677 6236: I really needed this reminder, my journey into data science started 2 months ago and every time I see anyones achievement I beat myself up.
20/05/2020, 22:20 - +234 816 677 6236: As too how much I think I should be doing..
20/05/2020, 22:24 - Muhammed: Apt 👌, Rome wasn't built a day. One step at a time, with perseverance and focus, we'd get to our destination(s). But never get intimidated by the achievement of others, life serves us in different dish(es).
20/05/2020, 22:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Please don't 

You are actually making progress, like real progress in 2month mehn that's great, so just keep at it and don't get overwhelmed or feel intimidated by anyone here including myself who started like 2years now or someone that started since 200l (7years ago, they know themselves😂), or someone who is born an Analytical in nature since sec school Andrew Ng @2348160626971 bro.

So keep at it dear

22/05/2020, 16:53 - +234 816 342 0137: Hello house, please I have a question to ask.

Can someone who graduated with B.Eng in Civil Engineering do computer science for masters and at PhD level?
22/05/2020, 16:54 - Yusfat: Yes
22/05/2020, 16:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Don't just say yes o
22/05/2020, 16:54 - +234 816 342 0137: In Nigeria or outside?
22/05/2020, 16:55 - Yusfat: Depends on the school
22/05/2020, 16:55 - +234 810 878 6913: Hahahaha... Baba wan port to Data science
22/05/2020, 16:55 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Some courses require background o 

So you might need to confirm from the school ooo
22/05/2020, 16:55 - Yusfat: Nigerian situation is an entanglement but actually, it's possible
22/05/2020, 16:56 - +234 816 342 0137: I've not graduated yet😒
22/05/2020, 16:56 - +234 807 847 2701: Nope am using the real whatsapp sir
22/05/2020, 16:56 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It varies, some can require you to have background or some relevant experience to support that you can actually thrive if given admission
22/05/2020, 16:56 - +234 816 342 0137: Okay
22/05/2020, 16:56 - +234 816 342 0137: I was thinking it's not possible
22/05/2020, 16:56 - Yusfat: Yeap, but it's impossible for any engineering faculty/dept not to have offered series of programming/computer courses... He may need to audit more courses dou
22/05/2020, 16:57 - Yusfat: In fact, most financial/bank jobs prefer ppl from Engineering (STEM) backgrounds bcos of their math skills ETC
22/05/2020, 16:58 - Yusfat: enquiries from the school is vital
22/05/2020, 16:58 - +234 816 342 0137: Okay

24/05/2020, 07:39 - Tosin Openiyi: I'm suspecting the second condition in your CASE expression. Since you are using a "AND" Operator, house the condition in bracket before the THEN

24/05/2020, 17:38 - +234 809 828 1153: Hello guys
Please I have a question
24/05/2020, 17:39 - +234 809 828 1153: Is it possible to use joins and subquery in one query on MySQL?
24/05/2020, 18:09 - +234 816 502 5257: What's the space between salaries and s
24/05/2020, 18:13 - +234 816 502 5257: Well I don't know this kind of method of coding but you can increase the loading time
24/05/2020, 18:36 - Yusfat: I knew it will either be u or @2348179651769
24/05/2020, 18:41 - +234 817 965 1769: 😂😂😂
24/05/2020, 18:43 - Muhammed: 🌚
24/05/2020, 18:51 - +234 902 044 0447: How? Kindly expantiate
24/05/2020, 21:29 - Tosin Openiyi: Your query is fine..... try restart MYSQL and try again
24/05/2020, 21:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Come and teach me na 😭
24/05/2020, 21:44 - Tosin Openiyi: My Oga.. You be excel guru na
24/05/2020, 21:44 - David Adeyemo: Boss🙌🏿
24/05/2020, 21:47 - +234 703 160 7868: This is lovely! 👏🏻
24/05/2020, 21:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Why you no remove the grid line for the one at the left?
24/05/2020, 21:48 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Did you use PowerPivot or it's just 1 data that has all the information required ?
24/05/2020, 21:48 - Tosin Openiyi: I'm adding it right away.... would have prefer to add data label tho but it's kinda messy
24/05/2020, 21:50 - Tosin Openiyi: I used Power Pivot oooo..... I was also forced to move the data to power query in excel for one transformation like that...
24/05/2020, 21:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Label will be messy 

I think it's okay just remove the grid lines since it's not giving any info
24/05/2020, 21:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Cool, PowerPivot the brain of Excel Analytics.
24/05/2020, 21:52 - Tosin Openiyi: It will help to easily track the price.... The data label make sense when I applied the slicer... something like this...
24/05/2020, 21:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I think you can remove the labels and y axis then and leave out the labels
24/05/2020, 21:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It will solve that I guess
24/05/2020, 21:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I meant remove the yaxis and grid and leave the labels
24/05/2020, 21:58 - Tosin Openiyi: Twale my Oga
24/05/2020, 21:58 - Tosin Openiyi: Thanks
24/05/2020, 21:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Oops

I get your point
24/05/2020, 22:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I don't know maybe I'm the one that just think the grid line should be cleaned.

You can use the ylabel since the data label really messy
24/05/2020, 22:04 - Tosin Openiyi: Cleaning the grid line is a standard Bro... And this look better and readable. But if I did not apply the region slicer, it will be messy.
24/05/2020, 22:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Nice one @2348110895622 for this though

Come show us way
24/05/2020, 22:07 - Tosin Openiyi: I'm at your disposal Oga mi

29/05/2020, 01:46 - Yusfat: Story time.

(Background information: I majored in Petroleum and Gas Engineering.)

During the technical session of my *SPDC Scholarship interview,* I was asked to name the fundamental law governing fluid flow in porous media (especially since my presentation focused on fluid flow), but I couldn’t remember at the time. Yes, on the spot, I forgot something as basic as Darcy’s Law which should make any panel kick me out of their sight and which if my lecturers found out, they would gang beat me.

At the end of my interview however, the SPDC representative (amongst the third party Lecturers and Professionals that made up the panel) was so impressed that she asked me to collect her business card from her colleague. I doubt that happened with any other candidate.😎 

*Moral of the story:* All your efforts up to this point and your further endeavours are significant, but one can not overlook God’s or Allah’s favour. What is yours will be yours!

*Call to action:* please share this information of the interview preparatory session with anyone you know who applied. Post it on your WhatsApp status and social media platforms. Less people benefiting from it may not necessarily improve your chances. I’m the only scholar in Imperial today (long story) and so, my very good friend @⁨Kess D.⁩, an Aberdeen scholar may not have being my direct competition.

Come open minded, I and my friends will be sharing *everything* we know!

30/05/2020, 20:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: DATEDIFF(interval, date1, date2)

Interval is what you want to return which can be year, month, hour etc
30/05/2020, 20:36 - +27 61 290 0591: Thanks. Datediff was just an example.

Normally after typing a function name, Sql Server  has an intellisence that shows what the function expects e.g DATEDIFF(interval, date1, date2).

Question is how can this option be enabled.

01/06/2020, 07:19 - +234 810 878 6913: How do these correlate python, SQL and power BI?

I know Python is for machine learning, modeling. SQL is for querying data while power BI is for visualization.

So let's say for instance, I choose to carry out a project. I make use of python for data cleaning and modeling, will it be nice to import the dataset to power BI for visualization, after I might have queried tge dataset with SQL?

@2349058285150 @2348110895622 @2348108522573 @2348108316393 @2348120919501 et al
01/06/2020, 07:37 - +234 807 463 7619: @2348108786913 is a choice you import the dataset to Microsoft Power BI for visualization but at the same time you can also use Python for your visualization
01/06/2020, 07:37 - Francis Atoyebi: I'll say you look at it this way... Power BI and SQL or Python and SQL.

You use SQL to query a database and then power BI to build a dashboard depending on what you want message you want to pass across and same for python after querying, you do your modelling.

Extra: if you've played with your power BI well, you'll know that you can use it to clean your data to a large extent without involving python.
01/06/2020, 07:38 - +234 807 463 7619: What matter most is the Result
01/06/2020, 07:39 - +234 807 463 7619: Thanks for sharing
01/06/2020, 07:39 - Francis Atoyebi: Python is mostly used by average data scientist but an average PowerBI user knows uses it for dashboard creation, dashboard as in a collection of interactive plots.
01/06/2020, 07:47 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay... Thanks all for answering
01/06/2020, 07:47 - +234 810 878 6913: I'm still trying to comprehend that's of Python in the second paragraph...
01/06/2020, 07:55 - Francis Atoyebi: What I meant is after querying your database, you can use python for your EDA, feature engineering and training or building a ML model and maybe do the deployment.

If you have a specific question, I might be able to tackle it well. 

But my major point is that you can use python for all you want to do without involving PowerBI and if what you want to do is create a BI dashboard, you can use your BI tool for it and assuming your data is too messy or is to be scrapped from a website, you can use python and then export so you can then use with your BI tool.
01/06/2020, 08:03 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. Thanks.

My question is that, can I use power BI and SQL for data cleaning, and take the dataset to ML for modeling? Without doing the data preparation and cleaning on Python?
01/06/2020, 08:06 - Francis Atoyebi: Sure as long as you are able to make the data a flat table that is ready to be used to train an ML model.
01/06/2020, 08:07 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. Thanks alot

03/06/2020, 03:31 - Francis Atoyebi: Confusing
03/06/2020, 03:34 - Francis Atoyebi: I don't understand the question
03/06/2020, 04:08 - +234 810 878 6913: Like is there a particular steps one will follow for data cleaning and feature Engineering
03/06/2020, 06:46 - Francis Atoyebi: There is no one step but there are various steps.

E.g your data might have missing data, outliers, wrong values and more, for missing values you can fill it using interpolation, or just imputing with a generic value be it mean or median or mode or any value, you can also decide to drop them or train a linear regression model to fill the missing data.
And for you to implement some of the things I stated above, there are different ways to do it in python.

Therefore I won't say there is one way but you just have to use the best practice approach and using any method that you know.
03/06/2020, 06:48 - Francis Atoyebi: For feature engineering, it depends greatly on you, your domain knowledge, how well you can better represent the information in the data and how well you can get more information from the data.
03/06/2020, 09:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks alot Francis

04/06/2020, 04:54 - Tosin Openiyi: Nah... It is capped too
04/06/2020, 05:28 - +234 817 840 3767: I sell Ntel mifi, routers  and subscriptions; I'm not saying this because I sell, but when it comes to unlimited subscriptions, they're the best.
04/06/2020, 06:28 - +234 703 365 7422: How much
04/06/2020, 06:38 - +234 817 840 3767: I'm not sure the admins would allow for such conversations here since this is a private business, I'll appreciate a private chat to discuss better until I go through the appropriate channel
..... Until then, please do private chat me for be further enquiry.

04/06/2020, 07:28 - +234 807 847 2701: So Ntel and swift which one is the fastest? Or have wider coverage?
04/06/2020, 08:25 - +234 708 531 6273: Smile data is not capped. I currently use their unlimited bundle. They only capped the bandwidth (6mb/sec) for the 24k and (3mb/sec) for 20k. 

In the past 2 months I have used 579GB
04/06/2020, 08:27 - +234 708 531 6273: Except you plan to connect multiple people to the network, any of the plans above will serve you well
04/06/2020, 08:29 - +234 811 624 5920: Someone is a data center here...
04/06/2020, 08:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Someone who is familiar with both can help prons and cons as well as the data rating and cost, it's time to disown MTN subscription.


Thanks.
04/06/2020, 08:34 - +234 811 624 5920: Mtn na scam... I use Spectranet... I get 50gig for 10k... And it can role over once you maintain the previous subscription... You however need to test the area you use it mostly... Be sure it's at optimum performance before you buy...
04/06/2020, 08:34 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Na Netflix hand be that o
04/06/2020, 08:35 - +234 808 325 6441: Not it’s unlimited 1-7am
04/06/2020, 08:35 - +234 811 624 5920: Lolz... I was thinking github or cousera...🤣🤣🤣
04/06/2020, 08:36 - +234 808 325 6441: You’ll have to be running around for network
04/06/2020, 08:36 - +234 811 624 5920: I use it... It will so distort your life and sleep pattern... 🤣🤣🤣
04/06/2020, 08:37 - +234 708 531 6273: You see this was my dilemma before I finally settled for smile. The smile girl had to sign agreement that he will refund me if I find out my  data was capped. And truly it wasn't.
04/06/2020, 08:37 - +234 811 624 5920: Security work better pass that awof...
04/06/2020, 08:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: MTN really is, the amount i spend on data is ridiculous.

Thanks.

@2347085316273  what's the plan on smile like?
04/06/2020, 08:38 - +234 808 325 6441: Spectranet is good if you hit jackpot the network can be very fast but on their off day ehn you fit cry
04/06/2020, 08:38 - +234 808 325 6441: 50gb for 10k how do you do yours bro
04/06/2020, 08:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Cool then.

Where did you purchase it? Ikeja slot?
04/06/2020, 08:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Lol

That feeling
04/06/2020, 08:38 - +234 808 325 6441: I hardly browse at night thou me wey no fit use my sleep play
04/06/2020, 08:39 - +234 808 325 6441: Lol seems this is the best option
04/06/2020, 08:40 - +234 708 531 6273: 20K and 24k for unlimited. Download speed is 3mb/sec and 6mb /sec respectively.

The other plans are normal just like MTN and co.

Plus Network has never gone for 5 minutes since I bought. Once there is no network, restart the mifi it will return immediately
04/06/2020, 08:41 - +234 708 531 6273: One girl selling online o . But I picked it up from their Ikeja branch
04/06/2020, 08:45 - +234 807 847 2701: But how many device can you connect to it??
04/06/2020, 08:46 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Thanks fam!

I will do my math and opt-in for the best option
04/06/2020, 08:46 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Ooh
04/06/2020, 08:46 - +234 708 531 6273: As many as you want o. In the first month of the lockdown. Almost all my family members connected to him. About 7 of us 😂

MTN na scam
04/06/2020, 08:47 - +234 806 840 6384: From the default settings is 10, but u can always configure the settings urself
04/06/2020, 08:48 - +234 806 840 6384: Or vi office if close to u, that's their head office.
04/06/2020, 08:50 - +234 813 948 5182: *You however need to test the area you use it mostly*

This is very important before you buy one.
04/06/2020, 08:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 👍👍
04/06/2020, 08:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Apt!

Thanks
04/06/2020, 09:01 - Tosin Openiyi: Spectranet will come to your house to test if their network is working fine before you commit to them.

Also they run weekly double data bonanza for subscription from 7K upward.

The koko is that you must ensure whatsoever network you are committing to have a strong network coverage in your area before you commit to them.
04/06/2020, 09:01 - Ifeoma Chiedu: Infact, this is the *koko*.
04/06/2020, 09:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Agba awo
04/06/2020, 09:02 - Ifeoma Chiedu: I know someone who ditched Spectranet for MTN for her work related matters.
04/06/2020, 09:03 - Ifeoma Chiedu: Can I carry this your word to their office and cash it?
04/06/2020, 09:03 - Tosin Openiyi: It will also be nice if they have some side attractions and their SIM can be used on universal modem.
04/06/2020, 09:03 - Tosin Openiyi: Oga mi sir
04/06/2020, 09:06 - Tosin Openiyi: A trial will convince you 😂

Back in the days sha, they promised to refund your money if you are not happy with their service. (Market strategy)
04/06/2020, 09:07 - Ifeoma Chiedu: We are in the days of covid-19. Shakara may have set in
04/06/2020, 09:10 - Tosin Openiyi: 50GB data no dey reach 30 days again 🤦🏿‍♂️
04/06/2020, 09:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 50/30 what?


I use 20/5days, extrapolate it to have an idea of the monthly consumption
04/06/2020, 09:13 - Tosin Openiyi: My monthly consumption is not less than 50GB 😊
04/06/2020, 09:14 - +234 817 965 1769: So I am now using 5gb within 2-3 days I am complaining
04/06/2020, 09:19 - +234 807 847 2701: So which one is better swift or smile
04/06/2020, 11:48 - +234 903 210 6832: 🤔
04/06/2020, 19:36 - +234 810 878 6913: @2348108522573 @2348110895622 et al
04/06/2020, 19:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I think it's an imputation using other 2 columns.

It takes 2 input as arguments  ( age & pclass) and checks when age is missing to use values of the different class to fill it given the class where the value is missing
04/06/2020, 19:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: pd.isnull() returns Boolean , so the line checks if the age is missing and perform the necessary imputation else return the original value
04/06/2020, 19:39 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't really get the Age[0] and Pclass[1]
04/06/2020, 19:40 - +234 810 878 6913: I know it's indexing
04/06/2020, 19:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The input is a tuple so you index the age and pclass out

04/06/2020, 19:42 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't really understand
04/06/2020, 19:43 - Richie: i don't think he will understand this explain more
04/06/2020, 19:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Okay
04/06/2020, 19:43 - +234 810 878 6913: You can help out sir🙈🙈🙈
04/06/2020, 19:44 - Richie: some one is doing a good job already bro
04/06/2020, 19:44 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: How are you creating the new field age?

df[age] = df[[age, pclass]]
04/06/2020, 19:44 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The input you want to use to create that column is a tuple of 2 elements which is age and pclass right?
04/06/2020, 19:45 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay Sir
04/06/2020, 19:45 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea
04/06/2020, 19:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Good.

In the function you are applying to do the imputation, the input is that tuple with 2 elements ; age & pclass


In creating that function you have to consider that  which is why you index the age and pclass out respectively using your knowledge of how the input is arranged 

Age = col[0]

Pclass = col[1]

Where col is assumed to be the input which is known to be a 2 elements, so if you enter more or less than 2 it throws an error
04/06/2020, 19:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Clear now?
04/06/2020, 19:48 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The reason you are using the 2 is because you want to perform your imputation using the class of the which will be a more logical imputation than a general imputation.
04/06/2020, 19:49 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Clear now?
04/06/2020, 19:52 - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you so much for this
04/06/2020, 19:54 - Muhammed: Guys do we have anyone who is working with an FMCG company here?

06/06/2020, 11:00 - +234 810 878 6913: *Be Intentional about Your Growth*
As you desire to get that job, change that job, getting a promotion or a pay raise and it looks like it isn't coming forth as envisaged, let patience have her perfect work.

Always learn to celebrate & appreciate your small wins at every step even when no one celebrates or applauds you. Reduce the inner pressure.

Make your career a project and be intentional about your growth by constantly refining your skills and adding more value to your personality, no matter how little. Set targets for this. Strive to be better than you were yesterday.

Avoid comparison - with friends and whatever you see on social media. Life is not lived there.

Also, talk to a mentor for guidance.

07/06/2020, 17:10 - +234 810 878 6913: Good evening friends and happy Sunday
07/06/2020, 17:10 - +234 810 878 6913: Pls I need help with this, or better still, I want to know the reason behind this action
07/06/2020, 17:16 - +234 810 878 6913: A feature has 3 categorical data named "C", "Q" and "S"

And I used get_dummies to make it to numerical data.

It shows this way
07/06/2020, 17:17 - +234 810 878 6913: Now I drop_first =True and that of "C" went off. Is it that the "C" isn't important in my modeling or what?
07/06/2020, 17:18 - Richie: You need to understand the code you are writing
07/06/2020, 17:18 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't really understand this. I'm using a video tutorial
07/06/2020, 17:19 - +234 810 878 6913: 🤔🤔🤔
07/06/2020, 17:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Autocollinearity
07/06/2020, 17:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's called the Dummy trap
07/06/2020, 17:19 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't get
07/06/2020, 17:19 - +234 810 878 6913: Can you kindly elaborate pls?
07/06/2020, 17:20 - Richie: What exactly do you want to see.. Its like you have something in mimd
07/06/2020, 17:21 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't have anything in mind actually. I was thinking since it's three categories, I should have seen three different numbers
07/06/2020, 17:21 - Richie: Why is he using drop_first...
07/06/2020, 17:22 - +234 810 878 6913: Like that of male and female. I saw 1 and 0, obviously 1 is for male While 0 is for female. But here, I don't know which one is for "C"
07/06/2020, 17:22 - Richie: Onehot encoding encodes in 0 and 1 even if its 20..each column will have 1 represented the value
07/06/2020, 17:23 - Richie: Like for any where C is in each row 1 will be append otherwise 0
07/06/2020, 17:24 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. I understand it's binary. But my question now is that, is it that C isn't important in the modelling?
07/06/2020, 17:24 - Richie: So you will not see 0 1 2  because you havr 3 instead you will see only 0 and 1...
Take a look at the columns and you will see for every where c is 1 is appended in C column and vise verse
07/06/2020, 17:26 - Richie: Well according to your code you dropped it.. Probably the author in the video thinks its highly correlated with others 2 which don't make sense to me.. Why not ignore the dropping part and see the outcome of the model.. Then you can check for correlation.. Possibly the C is not correlated with the target thus dropping is ok..

The thing is understanding the features will help you also... So do a correlation
07/06/2020, 17:27 - Richie: Exactly what i am saying.. It wasn't there for a reason which i think its either it is not correlated with the target or some other thing
07/06/2020, 17:28 - Richie: Na wa ohhh...
07/06/2020, 17:29 - +234 810 878 6913: 🙄🙄🙄 stop intimidating me na
07/06/2020, 17:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. Thanks alot. I now understand better
07/06/2020, 17:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks everyone. God bless you guys🙏🏽🙏🏽

07/06/2020, 17:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Is like power BI has more features than tabulae
07/06/2020, 17:41 - Tosin Openiyi: You can do web scraping on Power BI and perform unlimited data cleaning and massaging in the inbuilt Power Query editor.... Tableau work best with clean data and you will need a web connector to get data on web pages in Tableau.
07/06/2020, 17:42 - +234 816 502 5257: Wow
07/06/2020, 17:42 - +234 816 502 5257: Let's be doing monthly projects on this group too

07/06/2020, 17:45 - +234 806 840 6384: And challenging, that way hands will get more dirty and knowledge will be shared.
07/06/2020, 17:45 - +234 816 502 5257: Yes
07/06/2020, 17:46 - +234 810 878 6913: So one don't need data to do web scraping on Power BI?
07/06/2020, 17:47 - +234 810 878 6913: Abi na...
07/06/2020, 17:47 - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly
07/06/2020, 17:53 - Tosin Openiyi: To get data from web pages on Power BI, all you need to do is to select Web in the get data option and provide the url of the website you want to scrape.

Power BI will do some background magic and listed all the available tables in the navigator window. It will also suggest additional tables for you. Incase you are not satisfy with all the suggested tables, you can use the get table from examples option.
07/06/2020, 17:55 - +234 810 878 6913: Make sense

08/06/2020, 16:31 - +234 810 878 6913: When you have train data set and test data set, is it advisable to concatenate both data set before carrying out data cleaning and later split the data set, or you do them individually?
08/06/2020, 17:10 - +234 813 730 6439: First clean the data. 
2. Split your data into predictors and target variables (this entirely depends on your data set) 
3. You can choose to normalize the data
4. Split the data set into train/test sets
5. Model using the trained data
6. Predict using the test data
7. Evaluate your model by determining its accuracy of prediction or its performance.
08/06/2020, 17:10 - +234 810 878 6913: @2348179651769 @2347033448466 @2348110895622 @2348108522573 @2348108316393
08/06/2020, 17:12 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks David. My question is, should I clean the data individually (train and test) or I will have to concatenate to have one dataset, then later split to test and train
08/06/2020, 17:17 - +234 813 730 6439: First when you clean the data..  You are getting rid of rows with missing values or data that's doesn't give proper explanation to what you need. 

The output of a cleaned data is what you work on

You can do visualizations to understand what the cleaned data is all about. 

After which  you can now split the cleaned data into train and test set for modelling.
08/06/2020, 17:19 - +234 708 680 7803: I think he is working on the titanic data. The train and test dataset are separate.   I think You can decide to clean the data separately.  🤷🏽‍♂️
08/06/2020, 17:20 - +234 813 482 8979: Anyone you like..as long as you do the same data cleaning onthe two dataset
08/06/2020, 17:20 - +234 813 730 6439: Oh okay,  I really didn't know what the data set was about. 
Thanks
08/06/2020, 17:20 - +234 817 965 1769: ✍️✍️✍️
08/06/2020, 17:28 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks. But combining both and doing it once and later split, isn't bad Sha?
08/06/2020, 17:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks all
08/06/2020, 17:29 - +234 810 878 6913: I'm waiting for yours pls
08/06/2020, 17:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Your choice o

You can choose to concatenate them & do all your preprocessing at once & you can also choose to do it simultaneously

No rules, the koko is you understand what you are doing
08/06/2020, 17:36 - Richie: @opaino it happens that omdena founder wanted to have a talk with me.. I am no longer on the text project rather illegal dumpsites stuff relating to environment stuff

08/06/2020, 19:03 - +234 703 344 8466: Hello everyone😄

I need help to understand some python concepts.
I have a dictionary populated with values.. To get every key in the dictionary I can use  dict.key() right?

Okay what about if I want to get a specific number of keys? Say the first five keys or the last ten and so on. 
Slicing the dictionary eg Dict.key()[;5] etc doesn't work

Without using lists, isn't there any other way 😟🤔🤔🙏🏽
08/06/2020, 19:04 - Richie: Keys not key
08/06/2020, 19:04 - Richie: You can't slice a dictionary
08/06/2020, 19:05 - +234 703 344 8466: Right..
08/06/2020, 19:06 - Richie: Print(dict.keys()) should give you all keys..
Otherwise...
08/06/2020, 19:07 - +234 703 344 8466: Yes.. I also thought about extracting the keys to a list then slice it there but doing so will make my code cumbersome..
08/06/2020, 19:08 - +234 703 344 8466: Just looking for shortcut 😊😊
08/06/2020, 19:09 - Richie: Ya there is a shortcut
08/06/2020, 19:09 - Richie: Trying to think it out
08/06/2020, 19:17 - Richie: first_five = dict(list(dict.items())[0: 5]
Print(first_five)
08/06/2020, 19:21 - +234 703 344 8466: Thanks... Some minor tweaks and it worked 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
08/06/2020, 19:25 - Richie: Sure bro

09/06/2020, 08:14 - Richie: The y should be from the same data you got the X
09/06/2020, 08:15 - Richie: So lets say X = train.drop('targetcolumn', axis=1)
y = train.targetcolumn

09/06/2020, 17:37 - Richie: Now go back anf do this
Train['source'] = 'train'
Test['source'] = 'test'
Fulldata = pd.concat([Train, Test], axis=0, sort=False)

This will do a nice concatenation. The sort function was included so it doesn't sort it. If you don't include it python will warn you to either set to True or False,depending on your version
09/06/2020, 17:41 - Richie: Now after doing this you can perform all data wrangling then do this

newtrain = fulldata[fulldata.source == 'train']
newtest = fulldata[fulldata.source == 'test']
Now drop the source column in train and test
newtrain.drop(['source'], axis=2, inplace=True)


Replicate it for test
09/06/2020, 17:42 - +234 810 878 6913: Source should be my Target variable?
09/06/2020, 17:44 - Richie: No mu function is just for you to maintain the test data and train data so when you split back after concatenation you will get the exact size
09/06/2020, 17:45 - Richie: Exact size and index
09/06/2020, 17:45 - Richie: But i feel this is not your issue

But inverted data label are difficult to read. Also, you can use Nigeria shape file instead of the default map. Lastly, be consistent with your chart title format.

10/06/2020, 09:47 - Muhammed: 👍
10/06/2020, 09:47 - Tosin Openiyi: Best Practice...

1. Don't use pie chart or donut chart to display more than 3/4 categorical data. Worst case scenario (5). Hence, your total profit by customer name visual should be a bar chart and ensure that it is sorted by total profit (descending)

2. Tree map visual are difficult to read... You can use donut chart here.

Lastly optimise your chart titles...
10/06/2020, 09:47 - +234 816 677 6236: Busy, how please??
10/06/2020, 09:48 - Muhammed: Boss said it all
10/06/2020, 09:49 - +234 810 878 6913: Boss of power BI
10/06/2020, 09:50 - Tosin Openiyi: Another observation, when you are using pie/donut chart - always ensure that the legend is turned off and set the data label to show all data values. This is subject to debate tho but it will make your visual more neat and easy to understand.
10/06/2020, 09:51 - Tosin Openiyi: 🙆🏿‍♂️
10/06/2020, 09:52 - +234 817 965 1769: And SQL
10/06/2020, 09:52 - +234 816 502 5257: Nice work, the doughnut chat isn't the best here,

Total profit and gain ain't the same?

Use column chat for easy  reading

Cummulative calculations

Your cards are not where it can be seen at once

Your title does not stand out

Your slicer choice should have been in the chat as a visual not slicer

Since the aim of the the Visualization is profitability... The first chat should have been more clear, standing out and intuitive
10/06/2020, 09:53 - +234 817 965 1769: I will DM die once I run into trouble

10/06/2020, 10:17 - Tosin Openiyi: In the chart title section, enable text wrap 😊

You can also reduce the font size of the dashboard title. It will look more presentable if it's on one line.

Try to add the company's logo too 😊

I did but not proficient in it as at today.

CHOOSING A CAREER PATH

In the quest for choosing a #careerpath, I would advise you choose a #career that's challenging. A career that's not static and that won't make you feel relaxed. Yes, I could understand you have a degree in Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, Law and the likes. If the career path you're into isn't challenging, you can still make a career switch, mind you, it's never too late to... https://bit.ly/2MMRKSL

11/06/2020, 08:12 - Olayinka: The precision is a measure of classifier exactness

Recall is a measure of classifier completeness
11/06/2020, 08:13 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright thanks. From the result there, which if the category am I to go in for?
11/06/2020, 08:14 - Olayinka: Hold on... You are not choosimg any Category.
11/06/2020, 08:14 - Olayinka: What is your positive class?
11/06/2020, 08:16 - Olayinka: The reason why I asked is because Recall is the number of positive out of the actual positive result
11/06/2020, 08:16 - Olayinka: Precision is the proportion of actual positives that were coreectly identified
11/06/2020, 08:17 - Olayinka: F1-score is like an harmonic mean of the precision and recall. Usually people take the F1-score because it is more stable
11/06/2020, 08:21 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't really know🙈🙈
11/06/2020, 08:21 - Olayinka: Usually precision and recall are not replied upon because the classes could be unbalanced except you have upsampled

If the classes have more of the the positive class, then your precision will be high because its seeing (identifying) more of the positive class
11/06/2020, 08:22 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright thanks. I carried out a model on a categorical data to make a wise choice between survived and unsurvived. So I'm asking from that result, which am I to go for. 

Do you understand my question?
11/06/2020, 08:23 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay
11/06/2020, 08:23 - Olayinka: The reason why @2347062974329 said your model is not doing great is because.. It is a desirable to have F1-score well above 80%
11/06/2020, 08:23 - +234 810 878 6913: Oh I get
11/06/2020, 08:24 - Olayinka: This is not a case of choosing which class you want 😀

Why you build the model is so that you can predict un survived or survived with high confidence maybe in real world
11/06/2020, 08:26 - +234 810 878 6913: I'm sorry, I don't get
11/06/2020, 08:26 - Olayinka: Ultimately, imagine the ship company called you and said we want to know those who will survive or not for example..

So you have fitted the model with some features maybe number of siblings, etc
11/06/2020, 08:26 - Yusfat: Nice... Similar to not accepting a non challenging job offer👌
11/06/2020, 08:26 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't get
11/06/2020, 08:27 - Yusfat: Good write up
11/06/2020, 08:27 - +234 810 878 6913: Edit
11/06/2020, 08:28 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. So what's prediction did I come up with?
11/06/2020, 08:28 - Olayinka: So given the model you built, if they bring a new person in real world with the features you used to build the model. Will your model predict coreectly or not?
11/06/2020, 08:28 - Olayinka: Do you get?
11/06/2020, 08:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. I understand
11/06/2020, 08:30 - +234 810 878 6913: ??
11/06/2020, 08:32 - Olayinka: If you understand my point. I am not sure the next question is important
11/06/2020, 08:33 - Olayinka: The evaluation metrics you got from your model is just a way to quantify how reliable your classifier is...
11/06/2020, 08:48 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright thanks
11/06/2020, 09:05 - Olayinka: Other inputs are welcome

11/06/2020, 16:04 - Olayinka: I guess 1 is the positive class... The model has no False Positives
11/06/2020, 16:04 - Olayinka: One thing you must be careful of is the business understanding or business domain..
11/06/2020, 16:05 - Olayinka: What model did you use for this?

11/06/2020, 18:59 - Olayinka: You might have to do change of base
11/06/2020, 19:00 - +234 808 325 6441: Demystify
11/06/2020, 19:00 - +234 808 325 6441: To base 2?
11/06/2020, 19:00 - Olayinka: Ha.. He don tey o
11/06/2020, 19:00 - Olayinka: Yes..
11/06/2020, 19:00 - Olayinka: It should be log5/log2
11/06/2020, 19:00 - Olayinka: Something like this
11/06/2020, 19:01 - +234 808 325 6441: Let me see if I can do ojoro
11/06/2020, 19:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Change the base to  In
11/06/2020, 19:06 - Olayinka: Something like this.. Natural log
11/06/2020, 19:06 - +234 810 878 6913: Boss 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
11/06/2020, 19:06 - Olayinka: So the base will be 10
11/06/2020, 19:07 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: On top wetin? 😂
11/06/2020, 19:07 - +234 808 325 6441: I just did ojoro got x=2
11/06/2020, 19:07 - +234 808 325 6441: Koyemi
11/06/2020, 19:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Working with Naperian Logarithm of e makes it easy to do some fast manipulation with exponent
11/06/2020, 19:08 - Olayinka: Ha.. Gbèsè
11/06/2020, 19:09 - +234 810 878 6913: On top laws logarithms
11/06/2020, 19:09 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Is that base 5 exponent 2?
11/06/2020, 19:10 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm🙌🏽🙌🏽
11/06/2020, 19:10 - +234 808 325 6441: This is the question
11/06/2020, 19:10 - +234 808 325 6441: Don’t follow my own solution oo  me I was just assuming stuffs
11/06/2020, 19:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Ok
11/06/2020, 19:12 - +234 907 429 6313: Log2 ^2 is 1
11/06/2020, 19:13 - +234 907 429 6313: So you have 2✓2 on the other side alone
11/06/2020, 19:13 - +234 808 325 6441: What about the 3?
11/06/2020, 19:13 - +234 907 429 6313: Equate it to the right hand side
11/06/2020, 19:13 - +234 907 429 6313: And convert to indicies
11/06/2020, 19:14 - +234 907 429 6313: It will continue with it 
Make it 2^3/2
11/06/2020, 19:14 - +234 810 878 6913: x = 2
11/06/2020, 19:14 - +234 808 325 6441: Did u solve something
11/06/2020, 19:15 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea..
11/06/2020, 19:15 - +234 808 325 6441: Send let me see
11/06/2020, 19:19 - Olayinka: This one no clesr o
11/06/2020, 19:20 - +234 810 878 6913: I might be wrong sha
11/06/2020, 19:20 - +234 810 878 6913: E dn tey
11/06/2020, 19:21 - +234 810 878 6913: Try put 2 for x and confirm if I'm right. I'm not with calculator here
11/06/2020, 19:21 - +234 808 325 6441: I do not think this is correct because it’s same thing I did .
11/06/2020, 19:21 - +234 808 325 6441: I’m looking at this first make I write an see
11/06/2020, 19:23 - +234 808 325 6441: I don’t get In2 base 2 =1 right
11/06/2020, 19:23 - +234 808 325 6441: Where’s the in 2 beside 7/2
11/06/2020, 19:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's 7/4 there, I forgot to multiply by the exponent of ln 2^2 (the through goes behind and multiply the 7/2)
11/06/2020, 19:25 - +234 808 325 6441: Can’t be 7/4
11/06/2020, 19:27 - +234 808 325 6441: Or which one are you saying is 7/4
11/06/2020, 19:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Let me tidy wetin I dey do, I go recheck am well
11/06/2020, 19:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yes, but the numerator ln 4 = ln 2^2
11/06/2020, 19:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Right?

So it gives you 

7/2 ln 2 / 2ln 2. = 7/4
11/06/2020, 19:33 - +234 808 325 6441: Seen
11/06/2020, 19:40 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: x = 5
11/06/2020, 19:46 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I skipped some steps but I'm sure you can follow 😉
11/06/2020, 19:47 - +234 808 325 6441: I dy come
11/06/2020, 19:49 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I don't think there is a rule of log that allows you to transfer exponent of a base.
11/06/2020, 19:53 - +234 813 780 3722: 🤣🤣🤣
11/06/2020, 19:53 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I may be wrong o😂, there might be

11/06/2020, 21:50 - +234 903 124 0613: Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

12/06/2020, 00:40 - +234 803 420 2314: How did you get to study Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, sql, ML, excel... and get so good at them?
12/06/2020, 00:41 - +234 803 420 2314: Oh! I excluded power bi/tableau

12/06/2020, 00:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It take time bro, no pressure just give it time, and most importantly the more you practise the more it get clearer.

Btw I'm not good at them o maybe I have a fair knowledge sha above beginners level.

I
12/06/2020, 00:50 - Richie: Awon readers...

Most importantly it's easy learning on the job very fast.
12/06/2020, 00:52 - +234 803 420 2314: Thank you, i will keep lurking and reading your posts and watching all the solutions pisted here
12/06/2020, 00:54 - Richie: Plus practice.. Data science is more about practicing
12/06/2020, 00:56 - +234 803 420 2314: Is it possible for someone to just remain on the analysis aspect without going into DS?
12/06/2020, 00:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *No pressure* 

*Excel & SQL* is your major armory to survive any organization in Nigeria, so learn it well and be comfortable at it.

All the advanced tools of Python, ML, PowerBI, sorry only very very very very few organizations uses them, why? Many organizations don't have the architecture yet to sustain Data solutions which is a challenge and that's why Data Quality, Data Management are some of the solutions we offer our clients to help them prepare and manage their data to get the best out of Analytics and only few are ready to Invest in it.

So keep yourself updated and keep learning to position yourself for global opportunities but also try secure the bag here first
12/06/2020, 00:57 - Richie: Yes... Analytics is even the base.. The ML aspect is the prediction part... So its up to you
12/06/2020, 00:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 💯
12/06/2020, 00:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Solving problem with Data isn't only ML

Lot of business Data driven solutions that don't even require ML at all
12/06/2020, 00:58 - +234 810 878 6913: That's just the secret!
12/06/2020, 00:59 - Richie: True.. I most things sent to the Governor don't need ML model😌
12/06/2020, 00:59 - +234 803 420 2314: 😎
12/06/2020, 01:00 - +234 810 878 6913: Why checking the depth of a River when you don't want to enter?
12/06/2020, 01:00 - Richie: Governor needs insight from my end sha.. But its not to say they won't appreciate waste classification or using ML to solve llegal dumpsites
12/06/2020, 01:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So give it time and mostly know your plan learning plans and goals. 


Let your learning goals drive your learning after securing the basic bag of getting a job to pay bills first
12/06/2020, 01:02 - +234 810 878 6913: Securing the bag🙌🏽🙌🏽
12/06/2020, 01:02 - +234 803 420 2314: Cat dey chuk paw for water na but e no too like water
12/06/2020, 01:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's the truth o 😂
12/06/2020, 01:03 - +234 814 676 9743: Buh business analyst uses supervised learning
12/06/2020, 01:03 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay I hear you
12/06/2020, 01:03 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea I get. But the truth is that I'm thinking I'm not growing🙈🙈🙈
12/06/2020, 01:04 - +234 814 676 9743: N I guess most of them do it with excel which is very difficult to me though
12/06/2020, 01:04 - +234 810 878 6913: Are you currently working?
12/06/2020, 01:04 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's okay to feel that way bruv, the progress doesn't have to be Exponential as long as you are making that tiny steps
12/06/2020, 01:04 - +234 814 676 9743: Nope
12/06/2020, 01:05 - +234 814 676 9743: It's  just a trend I've noticed
12/06/2020, 01:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The guys doing stuffs you are envying didn't start in 6 months 

@2348110895622  I'm aware of starting data 2years now maybe more than, so don't feel pressured when he is doing cool stuffs, just give it time
12/06/2020, 01:05 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm... Make Data science favour me ooo, make e nr go over me Las Las as I dn leave Engineering for one corner... God nr go Shame me🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
12/06/2020, 01:06 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright. Yet to notice it

You go dey alright.

Securing the data bag isn't as easy as they painted it why many joined😂 which was why I wrote my last post.


Be prepared for the hustle
12/06/2020, 01:07 - Richie: Everyone thinks they ate not growing.. The truth is we don't know how we grew but we can tell over a period of time.. I am sure nobody here know the exact day he grew taller.. One day you jx saw you have grown beyond your previous state.. So apply this same logic
12/06/2020, 01:07 - Olayinka: (1)^365 = 1

(1.01)^365 = 37.783434332887158

12/06/2020, 01:08 - +234 803 420 2314: I will suggest newbies try challenges even if they know say them go fail, the thing is; the main thing is 'thinking about the solution to take' even if you don't know how to code it. That helped me a lot
12/06/2020, 01:08 - +234 810 878 6913: Progress?
12/06/2020, 01:08 - +234 810 878 6913: Na die I Dy be that oo😂😂
12/06/2020, 01:09 - Richie: Thinking of failing here is early.. Rather learning the right things in the right method

12/06/2020, 01:10 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmm
12/06/2020, 01:10 - +234 810 878 6913: How many newbies do we have here?

12/06/2020, 01:14 - +234 803 420 2314: We are newbiesing and go shey
12/06/2020, 01:14 - Richie: Go to kaggle
12/06/2020, 01:14 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't really understand that kaggle😢😢😢
12/06/2020, 01:15 - Richie: If you can spend a lot of time there just like you do here. I think it may do some confidence building
12/06/2020, 01:15 - +234 803 420 2314: Question development is a key thing on a dataset
12/06/2020, 01:15 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm🤔🤔🤔
12/06/2020, 01:15 - +234 803 420 2314: There's not much to understand there
12/06/2020, 01:16 - +234 803 420 2314: Just go, search for a dataset and read the data dictionary
12/06/2020, 01:16 - +234 810 878 6913: Some of the dataset I'm seeing there eh
12/06/2020, 01:16 - Richie: Go there and share here what you don't understand.. I am sure people will help.. You can say you don't understand something that you cam tell us what you don't understand
12/06/2020, 01:17 - +234 803 420 2314: 👍🏽
12/06/2020, 01:17 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. Later in the day then. I will go for it
12/06/2020, 01:17 - Olayinka: 👆🏾👆🏾👆🏾👆🏾
12/06/2020, 01:17 - +234 810 878 6913: How about GitHub?
12/06/2020, 01:17 - +234 810 878 6913: 🙄🙄🙄
12/06/2020, 01:17 - +234 803 420 2314: You have to know what you are looking for there
12/06/2020, 01:17 - Richie: Alright bosses... Just keep solving problems that's how you learn fast...
12/06/2020, 01:17 - +234 810 878 6913: I think uploading with there will be cool, if I'm not mistaken
12/06/2020, 01:17 - Richie: You save your projects there
12/06/2020, 01:18 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay boss
12/06/2020, 01:18 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea. Familiar with it?
12/06/2020, 01:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Why not take it a step at a time 😂😂
12/06/2020, 01:18 - Richie: You can also see solutions there
12/06/2020, 01:19 - +234 803 420 2314: My opinion is, use github like a vault to store your completed analysis and ml algorithms; so if need be, you can direct peopke to view them
12/06/2020, 01:20 - +234 803 420 2314: You can even request modification on your code in github
12/06/2020, 01:20 - +234 810 878 6913: I am thinking that, after I might have done any project, I will store it on GitHub to build portfolio for myself
12/06/2020, 01:20 - Richie: One thing i feel we should know is.. Let here be your last resort.. Don't rush to send your problems here.. Check stackoverflow.com then try Google check till you can't solve then come here.. It also help you learn how to solve things not depending on one person like that
12/06/2020, 01:20 - +234 803 420 2314: But you may need to learn to use git command also
12/06/2020, 01:20 - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly
12/06/2020, 01:21 - +234 810 878 6913: True oo... Stackoverflow has been my saving grace lately
12/06/2020, 01:21 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: ✓

You said it all, when all road closed and no way out
12/06/2020, 01:21 - +234 810 878 6913: That's where I'm having issues
12/06/2020, 01:21 - +234 803 420 2314: I absolutely concur. Stackoverflow is a programmers personal search engine
12/06/2020, 01:24 - +234 803 420 2314: There are just a few commands to master 
The code to push, pull, commit etc. But in the absence of using git, just do  it manually on github
12/06/2020, 01:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Great time with you guys👍

Good night
12/06/2020, 01:25 - +234 803 420 2314: Thanks, u a great man 😁👍🏽

12/06/2020, 06:43 - Muhammed: Good morning fam,  @2348108786913 and others, sorry I haven't been able to attend to your issues, my laptop crashed earlier last week and I lost 400gb+ worth of files 😭😭😭, I can't seem to understand why both of my HDD crashed at the same time. Though the devices were unused since February ending, I only got to pick up my laptop after the easing of the lockdown. I've been working with the official laptop my employer gave me.

If you have an idea of how I could retrieve my files 📂, kindly hit me up please 🙏, the backup I had on drive is about 100gb, but it's not the updated version of my files.

Thanks for your help in advance 👏
12/06/2020, 06:49 - Muhammed: I might still be unavailable/unaccessible for the next couple of days, please bear with me 👏 👏 👏.

I'm glad my bosses here @2348108522573, @2348110895622, @2349058285150 _et al_ are doing justice to the questions being raised here.

12/06/2020, 18:27 - +234 816 677 6236: Tried this it didn't work
12/06/2020, 18:28 - Tosin Openiyi: You can further drill down to the root cause of the blank
12/06/2020, 18:29 - +234 816 502 5257: I will advise you check if there's blank in your query.

Check your calendar table, ensure it covers all transaction date

Ensure a water fall relationship.. One to many. Single direction
12/06/2020, 18:29 - +234 816 502 5257: Else.

Report page filter
12/06/2020, 18:29 - +234 816 677 6236: Done this
12/06/2020, 18:30 - +234 816 677 6236: Would just report page filter
12/06/2020, 18:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Wetin u cause ni?
12/06/2020, 18:30 - +234 816 502 5257: Since the blank does not hold any value, you can filter off
12/06/2020, 18:32 - Tosin Openiyi: Na so....

She can double check from Power query if the blank make sense or not...
12/06/2020, 18:33 - +234 816 677 6236: Yes blank doesn't hold any value, I filtered it and it worked
12/06/2020, 18:34 - +234 816 677 6236: Thank you

13/06/2020, 13:46 - +234 706 839 0583: Hello guys, i need  help on a data am working on. 

I have this particular column that is classified as yes and no but i am trying to do a measure that will give me a total count of all the yes and no separately. Any help on how to go about it.

Note: Am using powerbi to analyze the data
13/06/2020, 13:50 - Tosin Openiyi: Use
 
No.Of.Yes
```=CALCULATE (
(Count [column]), column = "Yes") ```

No.Of.No
```=CALCULATE (
(Count [column]), column = "No") ```
13/06/2020, 13:51 - +234 816 502 5257: Calculate (countrows(the table), filter column is = "yes"
13/06/2020, 13:58 - +234 706 839 0583: Am still not getting the desired result
13/06/2020, 14:00 - Tosin Openiyi: Count the column where you have the yes or no answer..... you can use COUNT ([column name])
13/06/2020, 14:02 - Tosin Openiyi: To get the No. of yes, use = CALCULATE(COUNT([column name]), [column name] = "Yes")
13/06/2020, 14:03 - +234 706 839 0583: Thank you 

I just got the logic correctly.
13/06/2020, 14:05 - +234 706 839 0583: @2348110895622  and @2348165025257  thanks for the prompt response
13/06/2020, 14:21 - +234 817 965 1769: I think groupby can achieve same thing?

Can you share the group by formula?
13/06/2020, 14:27 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol
13/06/2020, 14:27 - +234 817 965 1769: I am not talking about DAX
13/06/2020, 14:56 - +234 706 670 9874: @2348110895622 can SUMX solve the query
13/06/2020, 14:58 - +234 816 502 5257: There's group by in power bi but I don't think it's necessary here
13/06/2020, 14:58 - +234 816 502 5257: Just like we can use calculatetable too
13/06/2020, 14:59 - +234 816 502 5257: It's a simple calc
13/06/2020, 14:59 - +234 816 502 5257: 🙂
13/06/2020, 15:00 - Tosin Openiyi: Can you some a categorical variable? 🤔
13/06/2020, 15:00 - Tosin Openiyi: 💯
13/06/2020, 15:10 - +234 706 670 9874: Oh sorry, I meant the COUNTX function

Just have intuitive title.

"DEATHS and survivors by age group"

I think The death and survivor card should be centralized since it's a focus area and be given a little bit space away from visuals and headers🤞🏽

I actually used that combo because the red can easily depits death while the green shows safe zone.😅
13/06/2020, 17:15 - +234 816 502 5257: I understand, just the alignment 😂

Needed to re write this..
14/06/2020, 00:41 - +234 706 839 0583: Ok, thank you for the question @2349058285150. Actually what i am trying to communicate from the visual is to know the rate of survival and that of death. That is why i created a visual in the form of a number display to give out the info, then i when further to show the trend base on category, gender and and segment all linked to a slicer.
14/06/2020, 00:43 - +234 706 839 0583: Yes I'm trying to show a trend between death and survival.

I thought trend should be based on an interval sha like time.. But to an extent it may bw allow... Jx reason the plot and ask if its necessary if not its better to use barplot expecially if you are your are just showing a count for the two variables

14/06/2020, 08:11 - +234 817 965 1769: Why do I need to know JavaScript along side with Python as a data analyst? Or knowledge of Python is okay for me?

This is hot topic. You can showcase your view.
14/06/2020, 08:15 - +234 703 344 8466: Python is all you need to know for DA.. Then R programming...Javascript is sparingly used especially in Web scraping but if you want peace of mind.. Stay away from that language.

14/06/2020, 09:47 - Yusfat: I mistakenly shared this here before I read the content and was almost deleting. But, before then, I saw it is also all about *data*... 
So, I am still safe from ejection/eviction😉
14/06/2020, 10:29 - +234 803 420 2314: My opinion; one needs to know the most basic concepts in .js especially in the area of web scraping. Sometimes, some web developers can be 'wicked' by embedding content with .js which makes it a little difficult to get when scraping.
14/06/2020, 10:33 - +234 816 342 0137: Just as a data analyst, I feel python is enough, but for someone who intends going deep into ML(creating interesting stuffs with ML and DL) you'd probably need more than just python... languages like JavaScript and C++ are largely used in the industry because of their extreme speed.
14/06/2020, 10:39 - +234 816 381 5935: In the spirit of giving back to the community and an attempt to break through the clutter of procrastination, I decided to publish my first blog post on medium.

Where I talked about the importance of passion and consistency.

Here's a link to the three minutes read:

https://medium.com/the-power-of-passion-and-consistency/the-power-of-passion-and-consistency-b8a87d3e9dd3
14/06/2020, 10:48 - +234 817 965 1769: This is my point too.
14/06/2020, 10:49 - +234 817 965 1769: I just woke up today and decided to strengthen my knowledge in JS at least above beginners or the standard JS for front end developer
14/06/2020, 10:50 - +234 817 965 1769: Exactly. So somebody planning to socialize in web scrapping needs more than Python. 

You will need to understand html, CSS and little JavaScript
14/06/2020, 10:53 - Yusfat: Yeap, u r on Point
14/06/2020, 10:58 - +234 803 420 2314: Yes o @2348179651769 html and css is a must know sef before .js
14/06/2020, 11:35 - +234 708 680 7803: Can we also use [ column name].unique().sum()  ?

You versatile gan o😊
14/06/2020, 11:46 - +234 708 531 6273: You don't need to understand HTML and CSS before entering web scraping and getting good at it.  The browsers will generate the Xpath for you.
14/06/2020, 11:47 - +234 803 420 2314: That is if the person sabi get xpath sef. So many do not know how xpath works.
14/06/2020, 11:47 - Yusfat: Yeap, but at least some knowledge as to know why u are doing what?
14/06/2020, 11:47 - +234 817 965 1769: 🌚🌚🌚
14/06/2020, 11:48 - +234 817 965 1769: God no go shame us
14/06/2020, 11:48 - Yusfat: Shei e lie?
14/06/2020, 11:49 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Help me confirm o

He knows little in everything

Webdev, softdev, BI &DS

Cool stuff, boss ways
14/06/2020, 11:49 - +234 817 965 1769: Yes
14/06/2020, 11:50 - +234 708 531 6273: Getting to know what Xpath is comes along with learning Web scraping as a whole. I never knew what HTML was when I started learning Web scraping. The tags are what you can get to learn like right now on W3School .
14/06/2020, 11:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: RT

No doubt we sure need some basics of softdev when it comes to deployment but not webscraping actually.

I never knew HTML/CSS when I learnt webscraping, all the tags you will learn it when you get a good resource for webscraping
14/06/2020, 11:51 - +234 708 531 6273: Of course. Like I said it's part of the whole package of learning Web scraping. One doesn't need to get good at HTML and CSS at all before knowing web scraping
14/06/2020, 11:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 💯
14/06/2020, 11:52 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Where is boss of scrapper
14/06/2020, 11:52 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: @2348110895622
14/06/2020, 11:53 - Tosin Openiyi: ```If you are writing PY script in Power BI then YES else NO PLS```
14/06/2020, 11:53 - +234 817 965 1769: That means you still need some knowledge of HTML?
14/06/2020, 11:54 - +234 708 531 6273: Exactly. Immediately I read what tags are I just grab am once . One doesn't need special knowledge on HTML to grabs web scraping as a whole at all.
14/06/2020, 11:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No fam.

You will learn it when learning webscraping, all the dev tools and all a good resource on webscraping will elucidate on it without having to learn HTML as a different topic.

No doubt you can learn HTML/CSS and JS like I said if you want to deploy and build solutions to be used by end users as a webapp
14/06/2020, 11:55 - +234 708 531 6273: That knowledge comes with learning Web scraping
14/06/2020, 11:55 - +234 708 531 6273: ✅✅👌🏽
14/06/2020, 11:56 - Yusfat: False positive🤔🙄
14/06/2020, 11:57 - Yusfat: I want b like him ooo...
14/06/2020, 11:57 - Yusfat: yeap provided it is acquired through a properly planned system
14/06/2020, 11:58 - Tosin Openiyi: Hmmmm 🤔

If the browser generate Xpath for you, how will relate with it when you did not understand the basic html and css.

Html and CSS (Js. Optional) are prerequisite for Web scraping and life will be made easier for you when you understand how they work.

Note - You cannot harvest information from web pages you have no idea of how it works.
14/06/2020, 11:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The idea here is you don't need to learn HTML/CSS as a separate topic
14/06/2020, 11:59 - Yusfat: 🤝🏼
14/06/2020, 11:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: A good webscraping course will teach you the knowledge you need
14/06/2020, 11:59 - +234 817 965 1769: ✍️✍️✍️
14/06/2020, 11:59 - Yusfat: It is already entangled
14/06/2020, 11:59 - +234 817 965 1769: Let me sit down and start learning
14/06/2020, 11:59 - Yusfat: Or already Embedded 😅
14/06/2020, 11:59 - Yusfat: Comot there
14/06/2020, 11:59 - +234 817 965 1769: Let me go and check this web scrapping materials
14/06/2020, 12:00 - Yusfat: Pls send me a copy
14/06/2020, 12:00 - +234 708 531 6273: Yes. I have not seen a  course on web scraping without touching the basics of HTML required to effortlessly carry out webscraping
14/06/2020, 12:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The way a web developer will learn HTML/CSS will be different, so do you want to say someone should go and first learn HTML/CSS before he can scrape the web?
14/06/2020, 12:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I haven't too
14/06/2020, 12:01 - Tosin Openiyi: Oh... 

Now I'm understanding 😊
14/06/2020, 12:01 - Tosin Openiyi: Na long thing be that.
14/06/2020, 12:01 - +234 708 680 7803: Thank yoi
14/06/2020, 12:01 - +234 708 531 6273: Understanding how they work doesn't require that you have to learn how to use them . 

Understanding how they work is part of every web scraping course. That is my point.
14/06/2020, 12:02 - +234 708 531 6273: Exactly what I have been trying to correct.
14/06/2020, 12:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I taught last Utiva Python cohort webscraping without the students knowing HTML/CSS at all, but I did a basic introduction of how a website operate and trust me they scrapped a static webpage during the training and dynamic web after the program
14/06/2020, 12:03 - +234 817 965 1769: I got it now
14/06/2020, 12:03 - +234 817 965 1769: Wow
14/06/2020, 12:03 - +234 817 965 1769: Great
14/06/2020, 12:03 - Richie: I know html and a some on css but i don't see a relationship between having the knowledge and scrapping a website to get information.. However if you know it na plus but its not a requirement.. Thats my opinion sha.. Afterall most DS don't even know how to use python well but as long as they can use it for analysis thats the point
14/06/2020, 12:04 - Tosin Openiyi: You have a good point......

Some badass Google chrome add on will do no-code web scraping for you. 😁

Power BI is tending towards that direction too 😁
14/06/2020, 12:04 - +234 708 531 6273: 🙌🏽
14/06/2020, 12:05 - Yusfat: Yes o, I quickly recalled those basis of HTML I learned back in 2016 during d Technidus web scrapping, before village ppl got me🏃
14/06/2020, 12:05 - +234 817 965 1769: I have problem with this point you raised.

We only use Python for data analysis.

So if you apply for python challenge, what you will see will make you feel like you don't know anything
14/06/2020, 12:05 - +234 817 965 1769: Why
14/06/2020, 12:05 - Tosin Openiyi: Life made easy when you can relate with them Bro. 😁
14/06/2020, 12:06 - Tosin Openiyi: You baptised them with Web Scraping anointing 🙌

Boss ways 😊
14/06/2020, 12:06 - +234 817 965 1769: 😂😂😂
14/06/2020, 12:06 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Python challenge is basically Data structures and algorithm
14/06/2020, 12:07 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That I believe everyone can learn
14/06/2020, 12:09 - Richie: We(data analyst, some DS) it all depends on you bro.. Nobody will kill you if you can't use python beyond analysis but if they employ you for analysis you should be thinking of maximizing their profits weather na python or lion.. E no matter.. After all Andela sack junior workers and i didn't here of one HR personal fired 🤣
14/06/2020, 12:09 - Yusfat: Bro, I was about saying u shd come outside sef

So if they need a bad ass visualizing (thank God for communities like this) or otherwise there are friends who know friends .... On Monday i will be talking to web and app developers and try to rate them if they are good..what do i know in development 🤣🤣.. All because i asked one question in meeting.... Who has access to the database, the kind of database and what language are they using .. Table flip like i said something important.. I was jx talking based on my role.. I hope you get the point sha... Like Opaino says"secure the bag"
14/06/2020, 12:19 - Yusfat: Lol... Naso bro
14/06/2020, 12:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *SECURE THE BAG*

That one you gas be street-smart oo
14/06/2020, 12:19 - Tosin Openiyi: You have put yourself on the spot 😁
14/06/2020, 12:19 - Yusfat: But u will definitely learn by listening to them
14/06/2020, 12:20 - Yusfat: Like those lecturers in school during defence😅😅
14/06/2020, 12:20 - Richie: 🤣.. Abi
14/06/2020, 12:21 - Richie: Sure.. I already started reading some stuff sef

Taking up job roles that will challenge one rather making one feel relaxed and earning free money💰

14/06/2020, 12:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Why no make free money and be doing challenging stuffs by the side?
14/06/2020, 12:26 - Yusfat: 😅🤣🤣
14/06/2020, 12:26 - Yusfat: Is there free money in this country?
14/06/2020, 12:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You dunno
14/06/2020, 12:27 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: NYSC allowed
14/06/2020, 12:27 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *allowee😂
14/06/2020, 12:28 - Yusfat: lmao... that's an exception... Fewer % get retained after NYSC
14/06/2020, 12:32 - Yusfat: We go all dey aiit by d grace of God
14/06/2020, 13:24 - +234 817 965 1769: I will prefer to take a  challenging job and learn under pressure
14/06/2020, 13:25 - Yusfat: ... than rather resuming at NNPC or DPR office gossiping and awaiting monthly alawee😅?
14/06/2020, 13:25 - Yusfat: rather than*
14/06/2020, 13:26 - +234 817 965 1769: Let me share my experience here. You know those uncle that knew that you studied mathematics education and not diverted into Programming.

So their own thought is that once you said you are into tech, you should be able to do everything
14/06/2020, 13:26 - +234 817 965 1769: NNPC too is challenging. 

I will learn on the ho na 😂
14/06/2020, 13:28 - Yusfat: challenWhat??🤣🤣

NNPC that wasted billions of naira to drilled dry hole (ordinary water Dem no see, not to talk of oil) last year
14/06/2020, 13:29 - Yusfat: Who type all these?🤔
14/06/2020, 13:30 - Yusfat: Chocolate will make person fall in love oh... it has to b moderated😅
14/06/2020, 13:31 - +234 817 965 1769: And the person is a web publisher. The website was created using WordPress.

So the Uncle said:

Abideen please help me change the look of my site, that the theme and necessary things.


That was how I changed the theme ooo and immediately the server went down. The site is not showing anything again.

The url is throwing error
14/06/2020, 13:32 - +234 817 965 1769: Oh boy come and see as my heart day beat.


Last last, I watched YouTube, Google and read documentation in the night. I solved the problem.

Then I knew that I can actually learn under pressure
14/06/2020, 13:32 - +234 817 965 1769: What would have happened if otherwise....
14/06/2020, 13:32 - +234 813 948 5182: Thanks @2348108522573 

NO 3 is relative though 😂, to some people chocolate will do, while to some folks na hot Amala.

14/06/2020, 13:59 - +234 703 160 7868: 6. *At times the HR recruiter may also get it all wrong too.* 

For instance, some HR person who has no inkling or has proper grounding around the disciple you are  interviewing for. e.g it could any role in DS and they expect that you should be able to know everything just because they went online and downloaded the JD used in assessing or grading you. That sort of interview will definitely end in tears for someone.

Our HR professionals can also do better.
14/06/2020, 14:00 - +234 703 160 7868: I want to believe these are tears of joy after you've been called to receive the appointment letter. Not so?💁🏼‍♂️
14/06/2020, 14:02 - +234 809 573 8595: No.
I've not done the interview.😥
I have an interview scheduled for this week.
14/06/2020, 14:03 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Virtual?
14/06/2020, 14:05 - +234 703 160 7868: Yes I know. I caught the drift. I was just wishing you congratulations in advance!😊. 

From what has been shared in this group alone. Trust mr, you've already a lot in your arsenal to be unfazed by any interview fears you may have.
14/06/2020, 14:06 - +234 703 160 7868: *me not ~mr~
14/06/2020, 14:06 - +234 809 573 8595: Yeah
14/06/2020, 14:06 - +234 809 573 8595: Thank you sir🤝🏼🤝🏼
14/06/2020, 14:14 - Muhammed: You're right about this 👆, let me share an experience I had with a company just last week with you guys.

I was referred to the company by a mentor, I went for the interview and it's partially virtual and offline, as the woman (MD/CEO) was in front of me, but her partner joined the interview over Whatsapp video call.

They needed a Data Scientist, but upon seeing that I doubled as a Data Scientist and Back-end Software Engineer at my former company, 80% of the interview session was focused on that. They're going into e-commerce and need to build a platform just like Jumia.

I confidently did justice (I believe 😁), to the aspects I understand, played around some, and came out plain at some points when they're asking questions relating to Front-end (as I wasn't a Front-end dev).

I was able to integrate my Data Science, Data Engineering and Software Engineering skills, to give them an overview of how the Jumia platform works, explaining the recommender system among others.

I also tried my best at the DS section of the interview.

The panelist said to get back to me if I meet with their requirements, then their HR will send me some dataset to work on, so I can display my mastery of DS as it relates to business development.

The HR contacted me about 24 hours after the interview, sent the dataset, asked that I turn in the work in 36 hours, which I did. Waiting on the final decision of the company sha.

Towards the end of the interview, I politely chip in and reminded the MD that I came for the interview as a Data Scientist and not a Software Engineer 😂 😁. She said okay 👌
14/06/2020, 14:17 - Muhammed: And all thanks to @2348110895622 on this, he gave me some great insights on this 👆.
Thanks 😇
14/06/2020, 14:18 - +234 818 936 4697: If you don't have my inner for chocolates nko
14/06/2020, 14:20 - +234 703 160 7868: Imagine! In their head, they'll probably be thinking getting this dude will save us a lot of costs, cos we'll be hiring a 2-in-1 person for the role...😅 

They want a Jacky on the job not just a Data Scientist.
14/06/2020, 14:21 - Muhammed: Àbí now 🤣
14/06/2020, 14:23 - +234 816 677 6236: Rejection!! I haven't had many rejection, still trying to build rejection shock absorber.. It was few days ago, I got rejected by a prospective business partner... I couldn't eat, I just felt ill all of a sudden.. I didn't even proceed with my other options, because I started to ask myself what I didn't do right.. Am not gonna let it keep me down, am gonna keep pushing till I get a Yes!!
14/06/2020, 14:23 - Muhammed: Immediately I left the company, I got in touch with my mentor, gave him a feedback of how the interview went, reinstated my stance on not picking up a Software Engineering position, he said he'll contact the MD immediately, he contacted me later that he took care of that already 😂😁
14/06/2020, 14:23 - +234 703 160 7868: Don't fall for it. Simply state a fee 3X the value you know you're worth. If they want you on both roles, that's if you won't have any problem handling it at the same time or else just carry yourself and walk away.🚶🏼‍♂️🚶🏼‍♂️🚶🏼‍♂️
14/06/2020, 14:24 - +234 703 160 7868: Exactly! You already took the best decision.
14/06/2020, 14:24 - Muhammed: Some of us are used to it, we've learned to harness those rejections to our advantage, built ourselves to be better than we were before the rejection 😁😂
14/06/2020, 14:25 - Muhammed: Don't mind them jàre, let me rest my head in DS for now.
14/06/2020, 14:27 - Yusfat: Interesting
14/06/2020, 14:28 - Yusfat: U get am... 🤣
Naso...
14/06/2020, 14:28 - +234 816 677 6236: Yes oo
14/06/2020, 14:28 - +234 703 160 7868: This the ideal. We should never let our spirits down because of the little bumps along the journey. You'll be fine. We'll all be las las🙂
14/06/2020, 14:28 - Muhammed: One point to note is that, it's very important to have at least one project to your gallery. While asked one of my milestone achievements in my former company, I gave them a walk through through a mobile and web app built for ARM Pensions, of which I was the ML engineer that built the recommender system for the app. That's one of my main achievements, we had some incomplete projects at hand owning to this Covid19 ish
14/06/2020, 14:29 - Tosin Openiyi: You are welcome 🤗
Your congratulations mail has been typed, wait for it.
14/06/2020, 14:29 - Muhammed: Amen ó 🤲

14/06/2020, 14:35 - Tosin Openiyi: I will never forget the day I passed through 3rd mainland bridge and the lagoon was smiling at me. 🤦🏿‍♂️

14/06/2020, 14:44 - Muhammed: Well my first time of seeing the 3rd Mainland bridge and crossing to the Island was sometimes last year 😂🙈, @2348108522573 will remember that company, where a Java developer was interviewing us for a Data Scientist role 😁🤣
14/06/2020, 14:44 - +234 803 263 4711: Congrats to the person
14/06/2020, 14:47 - Muhammed: Yeah, 5 guys were refered to the company, though they need 3 guys. So best of luck to all of them
14/06/2020, 14:47 - +234 706 942 4890: 🌝🌝
14/06/2020, 14:47 - +234 706 942 4890: awesome
14/06/2020, 14:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This is not correct.

I can tell you for a fact why because I have assisted my boss setup an interview with the HR for Experienced hire DS role.

How do they recruit for DS or tech related role?

The Hiring manager who is the boss or lead of the unit that need a candidate will forward what they need to the HR who will get the Candidates to be interviewed, the HR don't have Influence in the Recruitment at all, like at all.

HR only comes in after the Hiring manager has decided on the candidate they want and HR continue with their duties, so this is a wrong assumption I must say for a proper standard Recruitment
14/06/2020, 14:48 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What does HR know about DS to recruit for that role?
14/06/2020, 14:49 - Yusfat: But, how many of the HR understood or follow the so called *Proper standard recruitment* ??
14/06/2020, 14:49 - Yusfat: This message was deleted
14/06/2020, 14:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Standard organization you see that and I assume most do
14/06/2020, 14:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Let's not always think HRs are the problem
14/06/2020, 14:50 - Yusfat: Well, may God bless my country
14/06/2020, 14:51 - Muhammed: 💯 💯 💯, first phase of the hiring process is the HR picking the potential/successful applicants, their after, the board of interviewers decides who is fit to proceed with the application process, then the HR comes back into the picture to continue with the hiring process(es)
14/06/2020, 14:51 - Muhammed: Yeah, ideally HRs are not always the problem most times
14/06/2020, 14:52 - Richie: Well you are correct but so is the other writer see it from his perspective.. In Government... Make i keep quite but the HR is likely behave like the former speaker spoke.. And i am sure to an extent it happens in organizations that don't really have a proper structure and strategy..if my boss need a good hand oga won't go to HR.. He knows what he will get..
14/06/2020, 14:52 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: When you get rejected, move on

Yes, I know some don't  get back which is always part of life, but to always have that wrong assumption that HR is recruiting what they don't know so won't pick the right choice or so.

Rejections are part of life, so learn to move on and not throw blames
14/06/2020, 14:52 - Yusfat: Blame keh🤣
14/06/2020, 14:53 - +234 703 160 7868: I wasn't just speaking to DS roles. I was also speaking job recruitment in general.

After all, DS is still a relatively new discipline in these climes.

It isn't something specific to any particular industry. It cuts across most if not all.
14/06/2020, 14:54 - Muhammed: 💯 💯 💯
14/06/2020, 14:54 - +234 703 160 7868: Good question. If only some of us knew what HRs know.🤷🏼‍♂️.

But what's my own?
14/06/2020, 14:54 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I don't think a reasonable organization will ask someone without a domain knowledge of the unit to be recruited for to recruit for such.


There is HR aspect of recruitment which is where you do all your behavioral interviews, but core tech interviews are handled by the boss in the unit.

During my PwC Interview 5 man panel, the HR was just chipping behavioral questions why the rest were asking core tech
14/06/2020, 14:55 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I said DS and technical roles, not general which isn't specific 


Technical will mean require some level of expertise in a subject matter not necessarily coding
14/06/2020, 14:56 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I still don't get your point though 😂

Why will HR know what you know in the first place?
14/06/2020, 14:56 - Yusfat: Abi, what do I know sef, I can't blv say na me ask that question😅
14/06/2020, 14:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What's the standard Recruitment?

Who defined standard though? 

 Baba no standard every organizations define their recruitment, so nothing like standard
14/06/2020, 14:58 - Richie: Exactly and that behavioral interview can send some people home early🤣. Thats why in some.. Take note of the *some* organizations... I think this matter is a matter of deductive reasoning.. So i am avoiding generalizing... Some companies don't have this aspect figured out well.. Take note of the some again ohh😌
14/06/2020, 14:59 - Muhammed: You're right about this 👆, my own interview was a 2 man panel, the MD being an FMCG expert, and her partner being a Fintech expert, the MD was asking questions within her own domain (business), while the other man was also asking questions within his domain (tech).

I had to balance between the two (business and tech), while answering the questions thrown at me.
14/06/2020, 14:59 - Yusfat: Then, standard doesn't exist, but u used the word standard recruitment
14/06/2020, 14:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This message was deleted
14/06/2020, 15:00 - Muhammed: You went for second phase?
14/06/2020, 15:00 - Richie: All this one i am hearing 2 man panel 8 men panel.. In Government its "who is your daddy" 🤣🤣
14/06/2020, 15:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That was an abnormal and at the 2nd stage I attended, the CEO apologize that he was supposed to handle the interview as the SME but wasn't available and didn't want to have it cancelled (though in my mind I'm like why can't it be rescheduled). So that's a rare case not a normal
14/06/2020, 15:01 - +234 703 160 7868: I'm sure the experience you know is only related to the private sector. That's why you would even mention standard.

Have you followed how recuritiments are conducted in the public sector?
14/06/2020, 15:01 - +234 703 160 7868: You get it!👍
14/06/2020, 15:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I told you na, yes I did
14/06/2020, 15:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Their offer was ridiculous and I wasn't desperate for a role, so I just free them😂
14/06/2020, 15:01 - Muhammed: It's highly abnormal I know
14/06/2020, 15:02 - Muhammed: You never did
14/06/2020, 15:02 - Yusfat: Rotten Sector🤣🤣🤣
14/06/2020, 15:02 - Richie: Watin concern panel of judges or accurate time keep....well not like they don't exists but we know the candidates before they start applying im most cases
14/06/2020, 15:02 - Muhammed: Àwọn wéré
14/06/2020, 15:03 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Public?


I rest my case, wetin I dey find go there 😂😂
14/06/2020, 15:03 - Yusfat: Baba, u nearly made me fall from my bed...😅🏃
14/06/2020, 15:03 - Yusfat: 🤣🤣
Free money na
14/06/2020, 15:05 - Richie: Not only public sector of some of all this private companies do it ohh.. Na say our daddy name no day TV.. I know someone who got a job in First bank with i beg resume na.. Even me was begging him to resume 🤣🤣
14/06/2020, 15:05 - Yusfat: Rotten Sector
14/06/2020, 15:05 - Yusfat: Of course, some private sef worst
14/06/2020, 15:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Me and the CEO catch cruise that day wella o 😂😂


After the interview that lasted for like 1hr which went well I guess, he asked how much do I want to be paid, I told him, he smiled and laughed and said it straight

"This is what we want to pay, so we don't negotiate too much"

Me sef laugh, that I may consider working with them in future, case close
14/06/2020, 15:06 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Na why them no dey organize na 😂
14/06/2020, 15:07 - Yusfat: If I hear, even the MD of the oil company I was working with last year seems to apply for NNPC.

 National cake 🍰
14/06/2020, 15:07 - Yusfat: and we all knew the advert was because of Yusuf Buhari bcos he finished his NYSC around that period😅😅
14/06/2020, 15:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: E be things
14/06/2020, 15:08 - Yusfat: Sir?
14/06/2020, 15:08 - Richie: Let me not rule out God.. Because that's all that matters in job hunting.. I remember i first job in an engineering firm after school.. After the interview they even gave me better cash to take go house.. Local man was confuse for a minute...
14/06/2020, 15:08 - Yusfat: 🤣🤣
14/06/2020, 15:09 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What's your source though?

Be wary of invalidated assertion, I guess you just dey catch cruise
14/06/2020, 15:10 - Muhammed: Just as my previous employer did before I resigned 😂🤣.

My contract was renewed, but it's not worth it, local man just resigned less than 24 hours after the contract letter was sent to me 😂🤣😁
14/06/2020, 15:11 - Richie: Hmmm.. Na was ohh.. How you take know🤣🤣.. Or you work with TVC?. That same period some other oil cartel children finish too ohh😌
14/06/2020, 15:11 - Yusfat: about the MD or Buhari's son?
14/06/2020, 15:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Well, I would have taken the offer though if I didn't have a job atleast to secure bag pay bill
14/06/2020, 15:11 - Yusfat: Badt guy... Take five🤣

E go shock them😅😅🏃🏃
14/06/2020, 15:12 - Yusfat: Na Nigeria we dey na
14/06/2020, 15:12 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So I confidently decline knowing I'm still going back to work that day.

We will be fine las las
14/06/2020, 15:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: God bless Opay for me 😂😂
14/06/2020, 15:13 - Yusfat: Side hustle bah
14/06/2020, 15:14 - Muhammed: Taken what 😳, don't be deceived by the *Data Scientist* role you saw in the job description, I was working as a Data Engineer/Scientist, Back-end Engineer and Product Manager simultaneously, you see that it's not worth it at that amount. Considering the underlying factors I told you about 😁
14/06/2020, 15:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Side hustle ke
14/06/2020, 15:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Fast move from work to interview and back like you went on break
14/06/2020, 15:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I'm referring to what *I* would have done, we sure have different perspective about things 😂
14/06/2020, 15:15 - Muhammed: You meant their offer and not mine
14/06/2020, 15:15 - Muhammed: C*G consults
14/06/2020, 15:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You don't have to mention though
14/06/2020, 15:16 - Muhammed: Name not completed though 😁
14/06/2020, 15:16 - Yusfat: I pray to av such blend of skills ooo... Running from Geoscience to Data science is like from fry pan to fire even though I Intended to steal and go back to b a better Geoscientist...😅😅
14/06/2020, 15:17 - Yusfat: Wicked people
14/06/2020, 15:17 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It shouldn't be hard to uncover from Google

It is well.
14/06/2020, 15:18 - Muhammed: 🤔, you're right about this though 😔
14/06/2020, 15:19 - Muhammed: It's all part of experience
14/06/2020, 15:19 - Yusfat: Wait oh

1. Data Engineer
2. Data Scientist
3. Back End Engineer
4. Production Manager

Your salary supposed reach 1M I swear.

If na abroad, u can't have all these roles combined, and that were to b a possibility, then u won't be earning less than 8000 $ monthly
14/06/2020, 15:20 - Muhammed: Just look before you leap, not all opportunities are opportunity, some are glorified traps
14/06/2020, 15:20 - Yusfat: Yea
14/06/2020, 15:21 - Muhammed: All thanks to the company, I gained skills in Software Engineering and Product Management 😁😂
14/06/2020, 15:24 - Yusfat: Sure banker...

14/06/2020, 23:09 - +234 803 420 2314: For you to conduct a proper analysis, you need to know what you intend to achieve from thw data, thereby developing questions
14/06/2020, 23:11 - +234 803 420 2314: I just feel the mistake mist people make with datasets is , going straight up to visualuze what they are initially given.

14/06/2020, 23:14 - +234 803 420 2314: For example, using the titanic dataset; u don't just tell everyone the number that survived and those that died; it is already stated. Give insights on why a certain category did to others or which age range is most likely to......blablabla

14/06/2020, 23:20 - +234 803 420 2314: So don't just get a dataset and visualize immediately, you take time to see if there are things to deduce from it first before you visualize
14/06/2020, 23:20 - +234 803 420 2314: Oh okay
14/06/2020, 23:22 - +234 803 420 2314: When trying to do ml, some columns needs to be converted to 'dummy values' (0 and 1) so as to make your analysis run smoothly
14/06/2020, 23:22 - +234 810 878 6913: Nai that thing to deduce nai I Dy ask of
14/06/2020, 23:23 - +234 810 878 6913: Sure, I know that. That's feature engineering
14/06/2020, 23:23 - +234 803 420 2314: Baba na to study the dataset wella to know the column that will answer your question(s)

15/06/2020, 09:40 - Yusfat: That's the manipulative HRs... 

That's what's most common this days... 

Imagine a company advertised internet role, with many written exam and yet during oral interview *asking: how many are u in ur family*?
15/06/2020, 09:42 - Yusfat: internship* role
15/06/2020, 09:49 - Muhammed: 🤔
15/06/2020, 09:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I agree with this actually to some extent. This was same story my boss told me during my time in portharcourt in Oil&Gas where they all complained that when the whites held top roles things were better of but in the midst of things no better He still earn over 1.5M😂

Abeg make them rest jare
15/06/2020, 09:53 - Yusfat: No loud wetin... I was there na. The Biostratigrapher  (Mrs. Ad*****) where I had my undergraduate IT was earning 500k.

After she got a job with NAPE, na 1.5M ohhh
15/06/2020, 09:59 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmm
15/06/2020, 10:03 - Yusfat: I attend NAPE international conference every year, and since undergraduate we had been made to believe that ExxonMobil is d only company that recruits nothing below 2:1 except u have an M.Sc.

Engineering students have upper hand, kinda. First degree with first class @2348108522573  shoot ur shot ooo) is a great chance and ExxonMobil - one of the most prestigious giant oil company and the pioneer of that Interesting *Sequence Stratigraphy* do claim there is nothing like nepotism... 

That may be true but not fully. Last November, a guy we met exactt a year ago was having his graduate internship and we met again at last Conference. I asked him some questions and he was like *You need to write and pass exam*, it was his other guy (now on scholarship in UK) who told me after chatting him, that he got d slot too and it was not by writing exam but tru who-knw-who, but he has to go further his studies.

LinkedIn for instance, everyone there will be acting very civilized and with courtesy. But go to Twitter and discover those same human beings, you'll be amazed at their level of decorum. LinkedIn is for packaging.. suit and tie things. But twitter is the real OG when it comes to authentic human conversations.
15/06/2020, 13:55 - +234 703 160 7868: It's not that they are callous. On Twitter everyone is just their real selves.

Many are aware of possible scam but greed make them fall victim.

Many are unaware, but could not research before investing.

Anyone who knows me very would tell that scam is one of the things I post about almost everyday... 

A very close friend that seek my advice Everytime still went ahead to take a stupid risk w/o informing me and lost 50k he borrowed in the process. I discussed that with @2348108316393  months ago...

Pls, if anyone Introduces anything business/investment to you, let's say the name is 
SCRAPPERS NETWORK (for instance), pls try Google search *SCRAPPERS NETWORK SCAM* and that may save you from falling for scam... You need to learn how something works before putting your money. If you still don't understand, feel free to contact me. If it's wat am not familiar with, I can help research and then tell u if it will end up as a scam or crash...

I just feel like posting this bcos I hate seeing people getting scammed/hacked everytime😠

15/06/2020, 23:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Hope you know there is what is called salary range across sectors right?

Salaries by organizations are benchmarked by their fellow competitors to arrive at a scale, so don't compare Oil & gas.

I did my IT in Oil & gas and I can tell you my stipend was some graduate monthly take home, so the argument is kinda baseless though.

No doubt many organizations don't compensate well no doubt which is a reality of  the country we are in, so if you are in a place atleast where your bills are paid, keep striving and continue to job hunt, 30k job is better than NO JOB, motivation to learn at times will drop
15/06/2020, 23:37 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂

How did u paint me?

Hope it's not blue bcos I am not a Chelsea fan ooo...

Me am just here saying the reality. I also had my undergraduate as well as my postgraduate Internships at oil and gas companies... Etc.

You always respond like I have one kinda hatred for those companies🤣
15/06/2020, 23:40 - Yusfat: or HR generally
15/06/2020, 23:41 - Yusfat: Benchmark exist, yet there are different kinds of OIL COMPANIES... I mean, there are downstream sectors, upstream and middle stream

E&P 

Servicing
15/06/2020, 23:42 - Yusfat: Upstream sectors are the oil giants and they pay like ritualists and they also still get level ... E.g ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, Total etc are upstream that have oil blocks...
15/06/2020, 23:42 - Yusfat: They are the E&P
15/06/2020, 23:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: They benchmark with their fellow competitors

Schlumberger, Weatherford, Hallibuton etc na them Oil services with similar salary range 

Shell, Total, ExxonMobil their salary no too deviate from each other
15/06/2020, 23:43 - Yusfat: Exploration and Production companies with oil mining license

15/06/2020, 23:43 - Yusfat: Schlumberger is a servicing company. Without E&P , Schlumberger can't have a project to work on
15/06/2020, 23:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So SLB na E&P?
15/06/2020, 23:44 - Yusfat: No

15/06/2020, 23:44 - Yusfat: Upstream, but not E&P
15/06/2020, 23:44 - Yusfat: upstream bcos they fall into the category of search for oil and gas
15/06/2020, 23:45 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I sabi
15/06/2020, 23:45 - Yusfat: Downstreams is majorly about marketing, syppy change etc if am not mixing it up

16/06/2020, 07:06 - Muhammed: *30k job is better than NO JOB* I want to differ from this opinion, in this present dispensation, 30k is really not worth the effort, unless transportation and feeding are not included in it. i.e. the company takes care of your feeding, transportation and probably offer you accommodation. In an era where sometimes you subscribe around 20k if not more, what are you left with? Unless of course you are talking about someone teaching in a primary/secondary school.

This is my personal opinion though, which might be wrong to others, but that's how I see it
16/06/2020, 07:16 - Yusfat: Bro let's forget this matter jare🥱🥱🥱🤣

Some ppl need it.

Everyone needed it at some point in time b4 tins transform...

16/06/2020, 07:19 - Yusfat: That 30k na like 250k in places like Akure, Ibadan!

But Lagos, na like 🤔 1k. You may have to even extrapolate to negative
16/06/2020, 07:20 - Muhammed: Exactly
16/06/2020, 07:22 - Muhammed: Someone earning 60k living and working in Agbara here in Lagos is richer than someone earning 120k - 150k working in the core parts of Lagos, considering costs of transportation, feeding and other expenses
16/06/2020, 07:26 - Yusfat: For knowledge whc I am always desperate to acquire, I can do it without pay. I had once approached the CEO of an oil and gas company, and he asked me *when would you like to start.* I later found that they don't pay, and I spend btw 800-900 daily in d street of lagos (excluding feeding ooh)! 

Fortunately, I received training Worth 1 million naira at different instances with different sets of Niger Deltans who were sponsored by bujebudanu oil company who paid 1M to train each of them for 4 months while also paying them 100k monthly stipend.

Wetin man go do... 

Na wen I began to dey use style track some times claiming to exercise I know say nigga don dey go broke🤣
16/06/2020, 07:28 - Yusfat: treck*
The guys were 10 (1M to train each of them) and I was fortunate to reach same training for free, n training Is the core source of revenue of the company
16/06/2020, 07:30 - +234 708 531 6273: Please won't the Agbara person eat and spend on other expenses too?

16/06/2020, 07:35 - Yusfat: I will like to talk about manipulation here🤐
16/06/2020, 07:35 - +234 708 531 6273: You must be assuming the 60k is not spending on expenses too.
16/06/2020, 07:40 - Yusfat: as per recruiters, HR or hiring managers as it is related to the salepersons, authors (novel or movies) and politicians ways of  manipulating human people...

The employers manipulate ppl to think they are being helped with peanuts and that is why many ppl will continue to leave their jobs by breakit the hearts of employers seeking satisfaction else where...
16/06/2020, 07:40 - Yusfat: human ~people~ being 😅🏃
16/06/2020, 08:11 - Muhammed: Cost of living in Agbara is relatively cheap as compared to the core parts of Lagos
16/06/2020, 08:12 - Muhammed: Most if not all of the companies here in Agbara provide transportation for their staffs (though not 100% efficient)
16/06/2020, 08:13 - Muhammed: Food items are sold at a relatively low price here, owing to its proximity to Badagry and Benin Republic by extension
16/06/2020, 08:15 - Muhammed: You barely have to spend upto 5h on transportation daily, however, while I was working on the Island, my minimum daily tp to and fro the office from Iyana Ipaja is 1.2k
16/06/2020, 08:15 - Muhammed: That's outside of my of feeding and other expenses
16/06/2020, 08:15 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Really? 
Nestle is in Agbara and transport no dey .

So basically, you are saying if you are offered 150K outside of Agbara , you will prefer to stay with 60k in Agbara?
16/06/2020, 08:16 - Muhammed: Nestlé has transport, I can authoritatively tell you that
16/06/2020, 08:16 - Yusfat: Whc state are you Mr. AY?
16/06/2020, 08:17 - Muhammed: They have buses moving from Agbara to Sango, those going to Ikeja and other areas
16/06/2020, 08:19 - Muhammed: I served in Agbara, and I'm currently staying there at my brother's place. So if someone tells you the otherwise, they're but deceiving you

16/06/2020, 08:20 - +234 708 531 6273: 1200 multiplied by 22 working days is 26,400.  

Say your feeding and other expenses 30k. You still have over 90k to yourself.

I can't still see how earning 60k in Agbara trumps this .
16/06/2020, 08:20 - Muhammed: Algebra ko, Bodmas ní

16/06/2020, 08:22 - +234 708 531 6273: Oga I stay in Abule Egba and I work on the island. 1200 is already on the high side except you leave for work when every lagosian don wake up
16/06/2020, 08:23 - Muhammed: I leave home by 5am daily if you care to know
16/06/2020, 08:23 - +234 708 531 6273: So basically, you are saying if you are offered 150K outside of Agbara , you will prefer to stay with 60k in Agbara?
16/06/2020, 08:24 - Muhammed: Iyana Ipaja to Oshodi, Oshodi to Obalende, Obalende to Adeola Odeku, finally a kèké to my office. Do the arithmetic
16/06/2020, 08:24 - +234 708 531 6273: So how can 1200 be your minimum? 

Iyana Ipaja far reach Abule Egba ?
16/06/2020, 08:24 - Yusfat: Of course, except you want to b sleeping in a church or mosquito outside Algebra
16/06/2020, 08:24 - Yusfat: mosque*
16/06/2020, 08:25 - +234 708 531 6273: Where do you stay ?
16/06/2020, 08:25 - Yusfat: Island and mainland
16/06/2020, 08:25 - Yusfat: Lekki and Abule Egba
16/06/2020, 08:26 - Muhammed: Basically, you easily get a self contained apartment with reasonable facilities at 150k (agent fee included), while you need about twice (if not more) to get the same facility in core Lagos
16/06/2020, 08:27 - +234 708 531 6273: Lmaoo. For real ? By 5am  Abule Egba / Iyana Ipaja to VI is 300 max. I wonder if na taxi you dey take o. 

Those breakdown you are doing doesn't make you sound like a lagosian at all. By 5am you are breaking journey?
16/06/2020, 08:28 - Muhammed: Well we use different services as you stated 🤷‍♂️
16/06/2020, 08:28 - Yusfat: See, the first time I took Okada in Ibadan having been told by the rider that I am to pay 50, I was like, we never reach since?
16/06/2020, 08:29 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol . Which one is Lekki and Abule Egba ? Where do you go to work from ?
16/06/2020, 08:29 - Yusfat: @2347085316273
16/06/2020, 08:29 - Muhammed: Transport is IB is dope 😘
16/06/2020, 08:29 - Yusfat: Both
16/06/2020, 08:29 - Yusfat: Mostly Lekki
16/06/2020, 08:30 - +234 708 531 6273: This has not in anyway affected the status quo .
16/06/2020, 08:30 - Yusfat: Always moving
16/06/2020, 08:30 - Yusfat: 😉
16/06/2020, 08:30 - Muhammed: From Apata to UI distance learning centre, it costs me less than 2h, that was last year sha
16/06/2020, 08:31 - +234 708 531 6273: So you go to work from Lekki that is on the Island and you prefer to earn 60K in Agbara ? I give up
16/06/2020, 08:31 - Yusfat: For night oooo, around 10 pm
16/06/2020, 08:32 - Yusfat: I don't want to b too detailed...

Try understand his point.
16/06/2020, 08:34 - +234 708 531 6273: Mathematically there is no point to understand. If  stress is the motivation behind the Agbara decision, that I will understand. But monetary compensation ? Nah nah . Lagos is not that worse.
16/06/2020, 08:37 - Yusfat: Whc state are you
16/06/2020, 08:41 - +234 708 531 6273: Lagos. I have spent my entire life in Lagos.
16/06/2020, 08:41 - Yusfat: Why are we all working? No b bcos of Money?

Abi na to show say we sabi something?😅😅

Forget that thing... Why do people leave their job almost 2 month or 3 months?

I have a friend like that.

He quit oil and gas job last year as a geologist, data scientist and software developer experience for leadway insurance...


Could he have left if leadway isn't paying higher than the oil company?
16/06/2020, 08:43 - Yusfat: Those motivational speakers you see on Linket are also mostly motivated by money, no let any one dey decieve us with *what is ur motivation*? It is just a norm...
16/06/2020, 08:44 - Yusfat: Most of them won't tell u they got their job through nepotism or so... And they will come online posting keep trying whc we already all know about...
16/06/2020, 08:47 - Yusfat: Moreover, he has estimated how.much transportation takes from his money, so it is logically reasonable I think, to stick to jobs in Agbara. If one doesn't sit to do the calculation, one may not know the higher paying offer with far distance and d likes isn't economical...
16/06/2020, 08:48 - +234 708 531 6273: Ok bro.
16/06/2020, 08:49 - Yusfat: Ay, are you male or female?
16/06/2020, 08:50 - +234 708 531 6273: Male
16/06/2020, 08:50 - Yusfat: 😅🤔
16/06/2020, 08:50 - Yusfat: Holy spirit told me last night not to believe anything I am told from 8:45 am today

16/06/2020, 09:15 - Yusfat: Sometimes
16/06/2020, 09:16 - +234 810 878 6913: That's why I'm telling you that this young man @2348034445746 doesn't have a base
16/06/2020, 09:16 - Yusfat: E shock you
16/06/2020, 09:17 - Yusfat: base 2 or base 10?

16/06/2020, 09:23 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This is what you understand, job hunting for fresh graduate without experience is a laborious work forget even that you have skills o that's why I tell people there is difference between *Skills & Experience* ; skills you can hone via self Develop, while the later you can't learn it yourself because it comes via working on the job. Will I take a 30k job even if I will be at a loss knowing fully well *I will gain the experience* in the area of focus if I was at my job hunt period ? *💯 YES* without thinking twice, well maybe my perspective about securing bag differs.

It's very difficult securing bag as a fresh grad without prior experience as against an experience hire or someone who had been gainfully employed and looking for another better role. The 30K in 6 month with quality Experience earned you will move and get positioned for a better role, will you substitute the 6 month job Experience though 30k with 6 month 0 experience? 

I know it's a tough call, but at times you've got to apply some wisdom, secure a basic bag to pay bills and continue to learn till you get a bigger bag to secure, and I also understand that many organizations also take advantage of job hunting Graduates with ridiculous offers and all.


Like I said yesterday, if you didn't job hunt count yourself favored because the fact you have a job paying you no matter how little your job hunting for better role will be with cruise without pressure or desperation as against one with no bag to pay bills.


Gain the experience and it will help you secure bigger bag, so will I take up a 30K job as a fresh grad with no experience even with my skills knowing fully well the role will offer the Experience though no cash? Well, I will, I will draft a master plan to only stay there max 6 month, gain experience and leave.

Sometimes you've got to forget the money and build the capacity.
16/06/2020, 09:23 - Yusfat: Gen gen
16/06/2020, 09:24 - +234 706 499 0746: E don land

16/06/2020, 09:27 - +234 810 878 6913: You have said it all boss

16/06/2020, 09:28 - Yusfat: Two
16/06/2020, 09:31 - Yusfat: 1
16/06/2020, 09:32 - Yusfat: 2
16/06/2020, 09:33 - Richie: Nobody should argue this plssssssss... Very few people start with high paying salary
16/06/2020, 09:34 - Richie: Unless the experience is not there and he already made mention of it..
16/06/2020, 09:35 - +234 706 839 0583: The honest truth is no fresh grad in is right thinking would want a ridiculous amount looking at all the suffer he had gone through to get the certificate in school but when there is no experience to secure that big bag as @2348108522573  would always say would be very difficult. So instead of looking for the big bag, it's best one first go for the experience then later you can plan for the bag.

Taking @2348034445746  earlier chat, he said he had to negotiate with the CEO of a company just to be able to get the experience in that field which i believe is now securing the big bag for you. What am saying in essence is that sometimes one would have to pay the sacrifice just to be able to get a better future. 

So if you are still earning like 30k-60k it's still fine and good than not getting at all but within all planning and striving to earn more. 

Just my two cent.🙇🏽
16/06/2020, 09:35 - +234 708 531 6273: 100%

16/06/2020, 09:35 - +234 706 839 0583: Exactly
16/06/2020, 09:35 - +234 810 878 6913: From where?
16/06/2020, 09:35 - Yusfat: Where do u stay?
16/06/2020, 09:36 - Richie: Well somepeople are seniors so th can't even take 100k with experience even if they know the truth that it will never be like that forever
16/06/2020, 09:36 - Muhammed: Well you're right about this 👆, we view things from different perspectives. 30k for a fresh graduate without experience is something, provided that you'll gain an experience worth more than that, which eventually will place you in a better position in your career. But anything save that, I'm afraid, the stress is not worth it.
16/06/2020, 09:37 - +234 708 531 6273: Under Jubilee bridge or you move closer to dominos
16/06/2020, 09:37 - +234 708 531 6273: How many times you wan ask
16/06/2020, 09:37 - Yusfat: U said Lagos
16/06/2020, 09:38 - Yusfat: I have only asked once

16/06/2020, 09:38 - Yusfat: Wetyn I do u na
16/06/2020, 09:38 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright then. Thanks
16/06/2020, 09:38 - +234 810 878 6913: Ntinz

16/06/2020, 09:39 - +234 708 531 6273: Hope you are still very young and your BP is very low. Staying in that place can lead one to early grave
16/06/2020, 09:40 - Yusfat: Na Benin boy... No mind am
16/06/2020, 09:42 - +234 810 878 6913: So where's okay to stay if I make ask?
16/06/2020, 09:42 - Richie: Let me even tell you guys something about high pay..

 Don't be fooled with this high paying job ohh.. Weather you collect 600k or 1m it all boils down to how you spend your money..

Coming from a business background.. Side hustle is key...

I have seen people riding ridiculous cars to work that pays less...

You may think its about high pay till you start collecting 600k then you noticed you are still broke.. 10 years from now most of us wil earn in millions and then you will say it not enough... Why.. Because the mindset 

I pay comes with its own responsibility and trust me..
16/06/2020, 09:42 - Yusfat: Village
16/06/2020, 09:43 - +234 810 878 6913: True sha
16/06/2020, 09:44 - +234 706 839 0583: Yes bro i totally agree with you.

*The more the money the more the responsibility*
16/06/2020, 09:45 - +234 706 839 0583: Spending wisely and also investing to generate other streams of income also matters
16/06/2020, 09:45 - Muhammed: Mowe to Berger, use BRT to TBS/Obalende (depending on which area you are going) but TBS is most preferred. You'll get a bus to your destination from either of these places
16/06/2020, 09:46 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright. Thanks
16/06/2020, 09:46 - Yusfat: 🤔 Someone stays here oooo
16/06/2020, 09:46 - +234 810 878 6913: Go up again, u will see it
16/06/2020, 09:47 - Muhammed: Business man 🙄😂😁

You're right about this sha, it all boils down to financial discipline and your ability to invest in reasonable things so you don't end up being scammed as always being said by @2348034445746
16/06/2020, 09:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Baba forget this one I no need side gig with some big bag o forget o


Why do you do side gig ? To increase your bag 


The money management is not only for bigger bag securer but for everyone.

Abeg give me big bag if you have it
16/06/2020, 09:47 - Muhammed: You're welcome boss

16/06/2020, 11:07 - +234 703 344 8466: Fact
16/06/2020, 12:00 - +234 810 878 6913: The Economic Sustainability Committee (ESC) led by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called on the federal government to consider suspending the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp exercises for two years.
What do u think guys is this a wise move?
16/06/2020, 12:00 - +234 817 965 1769: Six months keh. At the end of three months, I am already hunting and using my experience in the company has bases
16/06/2020, 12:51 - Muhammed: 🤔, there are two ways to it, NYSC has really helped some people kick start their career, while it has also helped some jeopardize (permit me to say) their's.

For instance, I know of graduates of engineering who served in schools for the period of their national service, I might be wrong though, but I don't see a prospective employer counting that as part of their experience
16/06/2020, 12:55 - Muhammed: I taught in a school for 6 months during my service, before I joined my former company. I had to remove that from my resume, I only included the period of time within which I joined the company till I left the company.

Whilst some corps members were lucky to have served in places relevant to their fields of study, getting retained after the course of their youth service, the same can't be said of the majority
16/06/2020, 12:59 - Muhammed: Rather than take 12 months away from the corps members, why not allow them go into the world, find their purposes, discover how best they can get to navigate through their lives, rather than having them undergo the compulsory national service, paying them stipends, whilst after the 12 months, majority has to return to their parent's living room to start another phase of *adult-dependency*
16/06/2020, 13:00 - +234 810 878 6913: Why are you making me feeling bad now😢😢😢
16/06/2020, 13:01 - +234 810 878 6913: So true
16/06/2020, 13:03 - Muhammed: Even some who served in companies were promised heaven and earth, they were deceived by *Graduate Trainee* designation, given ID cards, had access to HMOs, they were made to believe that they will be absolved into the system, only to be shown the exit door at the expiration of their service year. While indeed they've gained some experience, most became comfortable that they never bothered to apply elsewhere cos their PPAs made them believe that they were staffs already, until they were *used and dumoed*
16/06/2020, 13:04 - +234 814 545 2383: NYSC is still a means to network with people from different places. Although, it's not every corps member that will make something out of the one year mandatory service.
16/06/2020, 13:05 - +234 810 878 6913: That's so bad
16/06/2020, 13:05 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea, I can relate
16/06/2020, 13:05 - Muhammed: Sure, no doubt about this 👆, however, you'd want to agree with me that in some places, corps members are seen as thrash (permit me to say)
16/06/2020, 13:06 - +234 810 878 6913: Places like?
16/06/2020, 13:06 - +234 810 878 6913: It depends where you served Bros
16/06/2020, 13:06 - Muhammed: Places like Ogun State, some of their LGAs/LCDAs, most of the schools there had no permanent teachers
16/06/2020, 13:06 - Muhammed: Yeah, I'm not generalizing bro
16/06/2020, 13:07 - Muhammed: At a point in time, just 3 of us (Corpers) were managing a secondary school from JS 1 to SS 1
16/06/2020, 13:07 - +234 810 878 6913: So true. I served there, but I was respected sha
16/06/2020, 13:08 - +234 810 878 6913: Same in my PPA😂😂😂 I became a form teacher for jss3 and ss1
16/06/2020, 13:08 - Muhammed: They recycle corps members over the years
16/06/2020, 13:10 - Muhammed: I was teaching 5 subjects before I checked out of the school, Mathematics (JS 1 to SS 1), physics, Chemistry, Computer Science (JS 1 to SS 1)and Social Studies (JS 1 to JS 3)
16/06/2020, 13:11 - +234 810 878 6913: So true
16/06/2020, 13:11 - +234 810 878 6913: I didn't accept ooo... I was teaching mathematics jss1 to ss1, then physics
16/06/2020, 13:12 - Muhammed: The owner of the school was even mean, when I couldn't take it anymore, I had to threaten her that I'll bring the attention of Federal Ministry of Education to her school, which wasn't a government approved school
16/06/2020, 13:13 - Muhammed: I was doing it for the sake of those kids, they had good ambitions, however, that school was never a good place for them to be
16/06/2020, 13:16 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea I can relate, but you see those my students? They aren't interested in learning. All they know how to do is smuggling of rice from contunu to Nigeria, and fuel to contunu from Nigeria
16/06/2020, 13:16 - Muhammed: I had to stop teaching Physics and Chemistry, cos there was no laboratory, neither were there basic apparatus with which the students could be taught. My students don't know what a metre rule looks like.

The funny woman (school owner), brought textbooks of 1983 for me to teach with 😁😂
16/06/2020, 13:17 - Muhammed: I can relate, serving in Ogun State and teaching in a school can be really frustrating 😤
16/06/2020, 13:18 - Muhammed: I told her the books are not used in secondary schools anymore, she said that's what she was taught with
16/06/2020, 13:19 - Muhammed: Mine knows all the market days around Agbara, Lusada, Atan, Igbesa, Sango _et al_ 🤦‍♂️
16/06/2020, 13:24 - +234 817 965 1769: 😂😂😂
16/06/2020, 13:27 - Muhammed: I have a student who was an outlier in the class, I wished I could afford putting him in a better school where he could get quality education and not the thrash offered in that school. His lowest score till I left the school was 93 (not only my subjects, but other subjects). While his mates are struggling to meet up with 40 marks, Ridwan is always making his 90s
16/06/2020, 13:29 - Muhammed: Dude wants to be an engineer in future, but I fear for his future, cos that school can't offer him what he needs to fulfill his career. It'd have been better if he had been placed in a public school than that school he was enrolled in
16/06/2020, 13:33 - +234 810 878 6913: Same as mine. Emmanuel is his name, a jss 2 Student. Most of my jss 1 and 2 Students are trying ooo, but you see jss3 and ss1? Pls avoid them
16/06/2020, 13:34 - +234 810 878 6913: I only had one student in jss3, that girl Dy give me wahala
16/06/2020, 13:34 - +234 810 878 6913: The ss1 students are something else. They nr fit find LCM or hcf
16/06/2020, 13:34 - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly
16/06/2020, 13:38 - Muhammed: My own students will give you a comprehensive list of alcoholic drinks, give you series of sweet names to call your bae/boo 😁😂
16/06/2020, 13:39 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂 na wa oo

From Sango Ota (part of) to Idiroko, those Students are something else
16/06/2020, 13:39 - Muhammed: These are students who can barely spell anything save their names
16/06/2020, 13:40 - +234 810 878 6913: I have seen them. I know what they can do
16/06/2020, 13:40 - Muhammed: Go to Agbara, you'll see hell 😂😁
16/06/2020, 13:41 - Muhammed: If you see them (female students) at night, you'll fear for the future of this country 🤨
16/06/2020, 13:42 - +234 810 878 6913: Like seriously?
16/06/2020, 13:43 - Muhammed: Yeah
16/06/2020, 13:43 - +234 810 878 6913: Na wa ooo
16/06/2020, 13:43 - Muhammed: Their deeds is older than their ages
16/06/2020, 13:44 - Muhammed: Wetin Musa no go see for gate ☹️
16/06/2020, 13:44 - +234 810 878 6913: Nr be new tinz Sha
16/06/2020, 13:45 - Muhammed: Yeah, but these are 13 - 15 years ago kids 🤦‍♂️
16/06/2020, 13:45 - +234 810 287 5586: This medium article worthy
16/06/2020, 13:46 - +234 810 878 6913: Ah! That's too bad ooo
16/06/2020, 13:47 - Muhammed: It's highly pathetic
16/06/2020, 13:48 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea, big one😢😢
16/06/2020, 13:50 - Muhammed: My experience in that area is not something I ever wished for, though it afforded me the opportunity to see another phase of life, not that what they were doing is a surprise, but the shocking thing is their age(s)
16/06/2020, 13:52 - +234 810 878 6913: I understand. But try to visit Idiroko, you will hail. I was so shocked when I saw a 12years old boy smoking
16/06/2020, 14:04 - Muhammed: 🤔
16/06/2020, 14:05 - Yusfat: NYSC na waste of time except they start paying corpers 250k monthly alawee, and if that comes true corruption go still enta ram
16/06/2020, 14:06 - Muhammed: 😂😁
16/06/2020, 14:06 - Muhammed: 250k 🙄, how much workers go de collect 🤷‍♂️
16/06/2020, 14:07 - +234 810 878 6913: Boss, e shock you abi?

Nai d same way I take shock when I see am😂😂
16/06/2020, 14:07 - +234 810 878 6913: U Dy mind Mr. Blockchain?
16/06/2020, 14:07 - Muhammed: Let's just forget about those people ehn 😅 🤣
16/06/2020, 14:09 - Muhammed: Minimum wage is 30k, Corpers are earning 33k. Minimum wage is meant for primary 6 certicate holders, FG is telling you that your Bsc, HND or BTech is equivalent to primary 6 certificate.

Not my handwriting though 😂😁
16/06/2020, 14:18 - Yusfat: Lol... I served in a missionary sch🤣
My principal wey go dey form holy holy, na WAEC dey I wait for them. I dictated to everyone the kind of apartment I want, treatment and everyone... They gatbno choice not to respect me. When I realized that d principal might finish me with language, I occupied myself with a computer training 🚆 I enrolled in... 

On WAEC day, even the principal had to carry textbook to solve his own subject (geography)!

I handled Physics but on physics day during WAEC their main indigenous teacher had to carry textbook to solve questions, but I had to intervene, sat beside him and requested for past question to solve questions and the respect came again in another form, showing them na from s/w I come from. They don't believe outsiders are better than then, and so they won't give we corpers ss3 class to teach.

I show Dem pepper, I wasn't teaching maths, but I ran away on that day after making them realize that I could comfortably teach further maths.

They wanted me to assist w/o wanting to pay... The principal was a pretender, I was so shocked to see him use textbook solve WAEC questions for a subject he handles! 
Malpractice and 🤐🤐

I shine no b small, but I could have been seen has trash if I wasn't strong headed from d begining...

People may want to rubbish u, but it depends on how u portray urself.

My students (Jos village) call me till today and they so much respect me to always dishing all lessons off hand.

Iyalaya😀😀
16/06/2020, 14:21 - Yusfat: Dem see u like that niooo... I even volunteered to teacher ss3 maths but my principal declined for 2 possible reasons , I think:
1. They don't see outsiders better than them wen it is even a lie.
2. They didn't want we corpers😀 (u knw na) to teach those riped ss3 femalt students... 

So, I ran away on Maths WAEC day after I made them figure out that I b math guru...🏃
16/06/2020, 14:23 - Yusfat: Jss1 to ss1🙆🏻‍♂️
Too much my nigga!  Forget say I love teaching, they can't dictate for me lailai except I chose to teach them willingly
16/06/2020, 14:24 - Yusfat: 😀😃😄 crook

16/06/2020, 14:37 - +234 810 878 6913: Let's say we're 30
16/06/2020, 14:37 - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly
16/06/2020, 14:38 - Muhammed: JS 1: 3
JS 2: 5
JS 3: 4
SS 1: 3
16/06/2020, 14:39 - Muhammed: Crazy schools everywhere 😂

16/06/2020, 14:44 - +234 810 878 6913: When I newly came, they wanted me to be teaching them mathematics in Yoruba. The ss1 Students
16/06/2020, 14:45 - Muhammed: But truth be told, I frustrated the life of the school owner before I left. She started the game, I showed her I was in for it
16/06/2020, 14:46 - Muhammed: I taught Mathematics in Yoruba, yet those kids don't understand nothing
16/06/2020, 14:47 - Muhammed: Imagine a school where students are promoted to JS 1 without writing state common entrance exam. JS 3 to SS 1 without the JSCE exam 🤦‍♂️
16/06/2020, 14:50 - +234 810 878 6913: Ah! Na u ooo🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽

16/06/2020, 14:52 - Muhammed: Yoruba was the official language in the school till I left
16/06/2020, 14:53 - Muhammed: When you say something, the students start looking at you like goat 🐐 head, you gotta tell them what it means in Yoruba Language
16/06/2020, 14:54 - +234 810 878 6913: Na wa ooo
16/06/2020, 14:54 - Muhammed: Let them just scrap NYSC and replace it with something meaningful (if any exists)
16/06/2020, 14:55 - Yusfat: Imagine, nonsense mentality... Many University lecturers fall into this category.

During my M.sc u would never blv I scored *1/10* in test, in my always best ever course just bcos I cancelled and didn't work my proving as exactly it was in the handout!
16/06/2020, 14:55 - Muhammed: But come to think of the implications on the staffs
16/06/2020, 14:55 - Yusfat: Everything na scam for this country
16/06/2020, 14:56 - +234 810 878 6913: Na wa ooo

16/06/2020, 14:59 - Yusfat: Do dey lack skill or experience biko?
16/06/2020, 14:59 - Muhammed: One was using the same material with that of another lecturer in Unilorin, both of them just just inscribe their names (individually) as watermark on their handouts
16/06/2020, 15:00 - Muhammed: Who's plagiarizing who? I don't know 🤦‍♂️
16/06/2020, 15:01 - Muhammed: As in, try give them something outside of their lecture notes, you're gone for good 😁😂

16/06/2020, 15:11 - Muhammed: 😁😂
16/06/2020, 15:13 - Yusfat: My summary of maths is this:
16/06/2020, 15:13 - Yusfat: Maths is evil
16/06/2020, 15:14 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂
16/06/2020, 15:14 - Yusfat: that's my simplest definition
16/06/2020, 15:14 - Muhammed: 😁😁😁😁

But it's the foundation of everything (argue with your keyboard 🙄)
16/06/2020, 15:14 - Yusfat: I lie?
16/06/2020, 15:15 - Yusfat: The more reason it is evil
16/06/2020, 15:15 - Muhammed: Evil 😈 is the bedrock of all good things 😁😂
16/06/2020, 15:15 - Yusfat: I wanted to post something over an hour but I forgot👇🏼
16/06/2020, 15:15 - Yusfat: This message was deleted
16/06/2020, 15:16 - Yusfat: Hello my people, please I need a reservoir Geophysicist for an urgent job placement in USA
16/06/2020, 15:16 - +234 810 878 6913: Not at all... Different approach to one answer

16/06/2020, 15:21 - Muhammed: Mathematics and Statistics 😁
16/06/2020, 15:21 - Yusfat: Slot dey for u in case oh... Then I will b calling u a Geostatistician
16/06/2020, 15:21 - Yusfat: that's another reason why maths is evil
16/06/2020, 15:21 - Muhammed: Make sense 🥰
16/06/2020, 15:22 - Yusfat: Money is the root of all evil, yet we keep chasing money
16/06/2020, 15:22 - Muhammed: That evil is why you can type using your device 😂🤣
16/06/2020, 15:23 - Yusfat: maths is evil yet we can't do w/o it...
Maths & statistics are incorporated into all those softwares we use...
16/06/2020, 15:23 - Yusfat: Yes, addictive/addiction
16/06/2020, 15:23 - Muhammed: Welcome to our world 😛
16/06/2020, 15:24 - Yusfat: The floor is urs... I am going back to sleep
16/06/2020, 15:25 - Yusfat: One Einstein quote before I sleep
16/06/2020, 15:26 - Yusfat: *Do not worry too much about your difficulties in mathematics, I can assure you that mine are still greater.*
16/06/2020, 15:26 - Yusfat: Imagine that coming from Einstein
16/06/2020, 15:26 - Yusfat: 🤣 the guy na clown

16/06/2020, 15:59 - Muhammed: Àwọn wéré 😂🤣
16/06/2020, 15:59 - Yusfat: I think it is like acquiring primary data w/o wanting to pay regard to secondary data as may be required is data analysis😂
16/06/2020, 16:00 - Yusfat: in* data analysis
16/06/2020, 16:00 - Muhammed: 🤣😁😂

Either way, NYSC comes with it's baggage, it can be favorable or a waste of time depending on where you find yourself and how you seize opportunities.

16/06/2020, 16:35 - +234 817 965 1769: Implicit bias, poor data, and people expectations show that AI will never be perfect. It is not the magic bullet solution many people hope to have. AI can still do some extraordinary things for humans like restore mobility to a lost limb or improve food production while using less resources. People should not discount the value we can get. We should always remember: AI is perfectly imperfect, just like us.

17/06/2020, 07:03 - Yusfat: Good morning. I noticed maybe yesterday or 2 days ago that PwC has changed their LinkedIn business Logo, and hours later, *Deloitte*. Just now KPMG has done the same. 

Probably, Ernest & Young, Accenture and the likes of them would have made a similar move?🤷‍♂️

Now, my question to @2348108522573 , could that be part of the post covid struggle, competition etc. among the likes of the Big-Four companies?


Those their new logos ehn, e make sense no be small😁😁😁
17/06/2020, 07:57 - +234 817 965 1769: 🤔🤔🤔
17/06/2020, 09:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You dey monitor them ni😊?

The rivalry among the Big4 no be here o, they watch each other's back  to do stuffs, if one of the Big4 make a move you can predict that others will make the same move, and that's why poaching and movement within the Big4 is very easy because the experience is similar.


Post COViD struggle will be client hunting and project bidding not logo o
17/06/2020, 09:11 - Yusfat: 😀😀
Thanks for that insights
17/06/2020, 09:12 - Yusfat: This message was deleted

17/06/2020, 16:28 - +234 802 825 9007: The "income" field is not the same name as it should be in the dataframe
17/06/2020, 16:29 - +234 810 878 6913: But I'm working on the same database
17/06/2020, 16:30 - +234 802 825 9007: Type df.columns and see what you are passing compared to what is there
17/06/2020, 16:52 - +234 810 878 6913: Not still working
17/06/2020, 16:52 - +234 810 878 6913: Is like the dataset isn't complete or corrupt

17/06/2020, 17:05 - Francis Atoyebi: Looking closely at this image, I can see that there is a white space before the income as in it is ' income' instead of 'income'.
17/06/2020, 17:12 - Muhammed: You archived this 😳
17/06/2020, 17:12 - +234 703 344 8466: Income column name is wrong... Check your dataset well to see if its actually there
17/06/2020, 17:13 - +234 703 344 8466: Yes yes youre right.. There is a space in front of the income column in the dataset.. @2348108786913  removing all whitespace from your column names is also part of data cleaning
17/06/2020, 17:19 - +234 810 878 6913: It's not there
17/06/2020, 17:20 - +234 810 878 6913: Is like the columns aren't named... So I will have to name it
17/06/2020, 17:20 - +234 703 344 8466: Use data.colums
17/06/2020, 17:23 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay

17/06/2020, 18:18 - +234 818 325 2919: You can use ice cream recorder, it record your screen and it allows you to send the video
17/06/2020, 18:18 - +234 810 878 6913: That's zoom na

17/06/2020, 18:31 - +234 706 839 0583: No like he would do it all alone nobody will be there online, then he would save it and be able to distribute it via any way he wants to do the distribution
17/06/2020, 18:31 - +234 703 036 1587: Okay. Then you should consider this

17/06/2020, 22:28 - Yusfat: The most difficult concept in d whole world is Quantum Mechanics. 

Na wen Mathematicians put eye for wetyn no concern them by Introducing *Bra* and skirt ( *Ket* )  into quantum mechanics (crazy physics) that d topic became so difficult for the physicists themselves...🤣🤣
17/06/2020, 22:28 - Yusfat: 🤷‍♂️

17/06/2020, 22:34 - Yusfat: I posted a pic here and on LDS around January/February. The author mentioned all those researchers who died onto quantum mechanics palava, and then said: *it is now our turn to solve the problem using...*

Very funny... Who wan die?🙄🤣🤣
17/06/2020, 22:34 - Yusfat: ontop*
17/06/2020, 22:36 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea, I saw it😂😂😂
17/06/2020, 22:36 - +234 810 878 6913: Mathematics is really evil, I agree with you on that
17/06/2020, 22:42 - +234 810 878 6913: Mad introduction😂😂😂

17/06/2020, 22:47 - Yusfat: I can't study such in this country except I travel out for it
17/06/2020, 22:48 - Yusfat: All the lecturers teaching Quantum Mechanics don't understand it... Let me prove that to u wth Niels Bohr's quote if I still remember wella
17/06/2020, 22:49 - +234 810 878 6913: You and quote 😂😂
17/06/2020, 22:50 - Yusfat: I think he said: If you first study it and u think u understand the concept, then u don't understand anything in it...
17/06/2020, 22:50 - Yusfat: That's not how e said it though
17/06/2020, 22:51 - Yusfat: This message was deleted
17/06/2020, 22:51 - Yusfat: Here is one of his stupid quotes😂😂

*Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future. If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet. Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true.* - Niels Bohr
17/06/2020, 22:52 - Yusfat: Those are 2 quotes I merged into 1
17/06/2020, 22:53 - +234 810 878 6913: Even in my secondary School days, I found it kinda difficult in understanding quantum mechanics
17/06/2020, 22:53 - +234 810 878 6913: In physics
17/06/2020, 22:53 - Yusfat: This message was deleted
17/06/2020, 22:54 - Yusfat: *"Einstein, stop telling God what to do"* - Niels Bhor 

😂😂
17/06/2020, 22:54 - Yusfat: U cannot offer quantum mechanics in sec sch man... Na die...

It was quantum theory back then
17/06/2020, 22:57 - +234 706 839 0583: I was surprised when he said he did it in sec sch oooo🙃🙃🙃
17/06/2020, 22:57 - Yusfat: 🤣🤣 no mind d guy...
17/06/2020, 22:57 - +234 706 839 0583: Motivator Joshua🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣


Just keep motivating us
17/06/2020, 22:58 - Yusfat: We need to verify whc sch he went to
17/06/2020, 22:58 - +234 706 839 0583: Exactly
17/06/2020, 23:00 - +234 810 878 6913: I Dy learn from you na
17/06/2020, 23:00 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂 definitely I will Bros
17/06/2020, 23:00 - +234 810 878 6913: Nai grammar school I go oo

17/06/2020, 23:01 - +234 810 878 6913: @2348108522573 make I be your PA na? 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
17/06/2020, 23:02 - Yusfat: Leme quickly digress.

In Geophysics for example, we make predictions. Looking at earthquake for instance, certain info we need include  *possible location of next earthquake*

*Size magnitude of the earthquake* and 

*Possible time* it will strike. That TIME is the most difficult to predict among all.
And, to be able to predict in order to safe human life in active earthquake regions, u have to properly study and  understand history of the earthquake very well, else.. u will predict rubbish w/o understanding d past
17/06/2020, 23:03 - Yusfat: same thing is applicable to future predictions of stock market prices, as well as future price precision of BITCOIN (since they are TIME SERIES)
17/06/2020, 23:03 - +234 810 878 6913: Data science can help out here, or don't you think so?
17/06/2020, 23:03 - +234 810 878 6913: 🙄🙄🙄
17/06/2020, 23:03 - Yusfat: Of course
17/06/2020, 23:04 - Yusfat: Total oil company partnered with Google last year
17/06/2020, 23:04 - +234 706 839 0583: Can one also take this into forex
17/06/2020, 23:05 - Yusfat: ExxonMobil partner with Microsoft I think, and many like that... Trying to apply Machine learning to solve geosciences (geological and geophysical) and petroleum drilling challenges...
17/06/2020, 23:05 - Yusfat: I think so
17/06/2020, 23:06 - Yusfat: We will still need historical knowledge of currencies bla bla bla
17/06/2020, 23:07 - +234 706 839 0583: Hmmmm
17/06/2020, 23:07 - Yusfat: Forex obeys time series
17/06/2020, 23:08 - Yusfat: in fact, it is a time series
17/06/2020, 23:09 - +234 706 839 0583: Hmmmmmm i have bin thinking about it too
17/06/2020, 23:09 - +234 706 839 0583: That there should be a way data science can be used in forex trading prediction
17/06/2020, 23:10 - Yusfat: History repeats it self
17/06/2020, 23:10 - Yusfat: If I give u a chart of Bitcoin price now, if u zoom in n zoom out, n observe very well, u will begin to see some patterns...
17/06/2020, 23:11 - Yusfat: repititively
17/06/2020, 23:11 - +234 706 839 0583: Hmmmmm
17/06/2020, 23:11 - Yusfat: although, many factors affect price.

Sentiment/human psychology, news etc. Make I stop there😁
17/06/2020, 23:12 - Yusfat: but d best way to do it is but analysis (be it autonomous/predictive)
17/06/2020, 23:13 - +234 706 839 0583: I would have want you to dive further but i don't want them to write our name as noise makers in the class🤣🤣🤣
17/06/2020, 23:14 - Yusfat: Incorporating machine learning to such can help u to sell u asset at ur set stop loss, even while u are sleeping or wen u do not av access to Internet...
17/06/2020, 23:14 - Yusfat: Machine learning is everywhere already
17/06/2020, 23:14 - +234 706 839 0583: Wow
17/06/2020, 23:14 - +234 810 878 6913: How about Structural Engineering?
17/06/2020, 23:15 - +234 810 878 6913: You trade forex?
17/06/2020, 23:16 - +234 706 839 0583: Still learning
17/06/2020, 23:16 - Yusfat: but in the area of earthquake studies (called Seismology), it is a form of data analysis or science even before data science was born!


Data science is not really new as we used to think.. it is just a new way of doing old things, by blending many things together. That's why it is *multidisciplinary*
17/06/2020, 23:16 - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. I dn run oo
17/06/2020, 23:16 - +234 706 839 0583: Lol why
17/06/2020, 23:16 - Yusfat: Every discipline works in oil company
17/06/2020, 23:17 - +234 810 878 6913: I nr Dy understand the indicators
17/06/2020, 23:17 - Yusfat: But those that search for the oil n gas are the geoscientists with reservoir engineers
17/06/2020, 23:19 - +234 706 839 0583: I trade Vix sha

I can refer you to a forex coach sha. He is the no. 1 forex coach in Africa
17/06/2020, 23:19 - Yusfat: 😂😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:19 - Yusfat: If I hear
17/06/2020, 23:20 - +234 810 878 6913: Nai so Dem Dy talk ooo
17/06/2020, 23:20 - Yusfat: Most of those coaches copy signals on some websites.. no let make Dem dey bambooze u oo

17/06/2020, 23:22 - +234 706 839 0583: Hmmmm you might be right but still i can bet on this one.

Ejimi Olufukeji 

You can profile him.
17/06/2020, 23:23 - Yusfat: Shell launched their Blockchain trading platform in November 2018... Oil is traded in d stock market u knw
17/06/2020, 23:24 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I agree with this fact 💯

During my internship with SLB it's just now it's clicking in my head that they have actually been doing insights generation because when a tool get sent out to the rig for drilling operation and returns, we do what is called basket test which is basically to dump all the data from the electromagnetic sensor of the drilling tool and check to see if there was any spikes at all from the graph, we have a tool that generate the graph then and we just see if the tool operated optimally or there was an action

There was a time there was a form of kick that affect the tool the graph showed the anomaly , but didn't know we were using data to make sense
17/06/2020, 23:25 - Yusfat: 🤝🏼 anomaly...

That's a term we Geophysics student can use to give any form of description of d female attributes🤣🤣
17/06/2020, 23:25 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂 so true
17/06/2020, 23:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: There is an arm of SLB then called Geoservices that does a lot of that stuff
17/06/2020, 23:26 - Yusfat: Anomaly (abnormalities) is all geophysicist are looking for...
17/06/2020, 23:27 - +234 810 878 6913: 🙏🏽🙏🏽
17/06/2020, 23:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Pet is just too monotonous as a job jare
17/06/2020, 23:28 - Yusfat: Yea, the graph will show d kick... It is called a spike...

The drilling bit probably could have hit an unforeseen substance... (I am trying to figure out the right term... My head don empty😂)

Probably seismic didn't reveal a hidden geological target that goes beyond seismic resolution
17/06/2020, 23:29 - +234 810 878 6913: Wetin make your head empty?
17/06/2020, 23:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: My boss will say "The Job is boring but it's the money that is closing my mouth "


He said ope I can't imagine going to work somewhere else and they will pay me crap money 😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Oh! That's where you learned how to secure the bag, isn't it?
17/06/2020, 23:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I sabi all those term that year o, e dey boil for my brain wey I think say I go land Oil company

I read all SLB Oil CD, it's like a full documentation fresh graduate do read that contain most if not all their services and details
17/06/2020, 23:30 - +234 814 676 9743: Lol, I was about saying this 

Oil money!!!
17/06/2020, 23:30 - Yusfat: Yea, SLB are the pioneer of Petrel Software. Funny enough, Petrel can do Neutral network. I didn't know about deep learning or so back then we use to work on it
17/06/2020, 23:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yes, petrel

That's the name
17/06/2020, 23:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂😂😂


You can't secure Oil money and your eye with open 😂😉
17/06/2020, 23:32 - Yusfat: It's like saying Python... It is the first thing newbies get familiar with
17/06/2020, 23:33 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *won't
17/06/2020, 23:33 - Yusfat: Bro, in my philosophy, the easiest way to get in to that f**king oil company is through the back door.

Ask me what d back door is...
17/06/2020, 23:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Guy
17/06/2020, 23:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You are correct
17/06/2020, 23:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Let me gist you small
17/06/2020, 23:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: @2348161708710 can bear me witness 😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:34 - Yusfat: Of course, u go get confident die. 

U will even begin dey call or approach ladies u dare not try b4😂
17/06/2020, 23:34 - Yusfat: No wahal
17/06/2020, 23:35 - +234 810 878 6913: You got you there😂😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:35 - Yusfat: U never ask me wat d back door is na
17/06/2020, 23:35 - +234 814 676 9743: As money don dey too much na
17/06/2020, 23:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I was the only guy that came in using test from my school.

During the 1st week of resumption our supervisor was sha doing introduction of new interns 

4 of us joined the department

Them sha point to each person, this one na so so so person son and that one na this, e reach my stage , na so my supervisor ask me, who is your daddy? How did you get here?
17/06/2020, 23:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂
17/06/2020, 23:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I said God is my daddy 😂

That SLB came to pick me by themselves so I no sabi anybody
17/06/2020, 23:36 - Yusfat: My 6 months last year, come see as girls sef dey fall... Me wey no like woman😆😄
17/06/2020, 23:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Mad moral 😂😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:37 - Yusfat: 🤣
17/06/2020, 23:38 - Yusfat: You are right, but seems u haven't got my point. 

The back door I was talking of is even as a *Data scientist*

It's easier in my opinion to now get in through that door as a Data scientist
17/06/2020, 23:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Na as manager I wan enter Oil & gas
17/06/2020, 23:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You think me I wan write code all my life?
17/06/2020, 23:39 - Yusfat: 🤣🤣😄😄

17/06/2020, 23:40 - Yusfat: Well, *Data Manager* is still okay...
17/06/2020, 23:40 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No bro

Man always in the move to secure the bag with grandstyle o, I go dey coordinate people wey go dey write the code
17/06/2020, 23:40 - +234 814 676 9743: That one na very big bag o
17/06/2020, 23:40 - +234 810 878 6913: 😂😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:40 - Yusfat: Na d tin... Data Manager
17/06/2020, 23:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You get the gist 


Coding is a means to an end for me in the plan😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:41 - Yusfat: U go dey coordinate ML engineers, Data scientists and all
17/06/2020, 23:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Coordination and supervision sweet die though e dey stressful too but few project supervision and management I don do in the last 3 month e dey sweet me gan 😂😂
17/06/2020, 23:43 - Yusfat: 😄 e make sense
17/06/2020, 23:43 - Yusfat: Guy, comot for my screen joor😄😄

With sadness and unexpected experience, I wish to inform you that I was scammed yesterday of $497 ETH. That's about #196k and the money is meant for a client.


I know everywhere is dry and to borrow big money is not visible in this lockdown, that's why I'm seeking for help.

I'm pleading to the group members to borrow me #1k, #2k etc to pay this client. It will be of great help to me and I wish to refund anyone once I'm fully recover.

The pressure I'm facing presently is much, kindly help my life.

18/06/2020, 08:08 - Yusfat: How To Retrieve Your Money After You Have Been Scammed...

I am sharing a knowledge today on "Tips on how to retrieve your money after you have been scammed".

Please read careful and learn.

20% of social media users and shoppers have been scammed at one point or the other, either large bucks or small money and It's quite painful.

Many people don't always know what to do, so today am sharing with you things you do, when you realize a page you paid for a service or goods is ghosting you:

1. Screenshot all previous chats across all messaging app (IG and WhatsApp or FB).

2. Write out the Full name and account number of the page or person.

3. Go to the last notification your bank sent you after you made the payment (via mobile app or text).

4. Go to the last notification your bank sent you after you made the payment (via mobile app or text) copy out the "TRANSACTION ID NUMBER".

5. Go to any branch of the scam artist's bank (the bank the scammer uses), ask to see the CUSTOMER SERVICE in charge of FRAUD.

6. If you can, print out all those chats with the scammer, and submit it.

While you are there, send an email to SCAMMER'S BANK and copy CBN FRAUD DESK *(anticorruptionunit@cenbank.org).* this will ginger the bank to take it up fast.

What should you expect from this? The culprit/suspects account will be PLACED ON HOLD.

Meaning he/she cannot transfer or withdraw until they visit the bank, and when they do, the bank will contact the police and the suspect when proven guilty will sign a waiver allowing the bank to refund your money.

Never forget this.

Feel free to save and share...

Why didn't you bother about playing football, what if someone sees that as offensive too?

I'm just creating an impression because he might think the hobby will come in handy in the job

*HOW SOME OF THEM ENDED UP AS LAWYERS*
_laugh wan tear my belle_

_FUNNY BUT TRUE !!!_
*1*. Remember Further Maths
 (aka _Additional Mathematics_) ???
They warned you that it'd be tough so you committed to listening attentively from the very beginning...
*2*. ...things started very well. 2a+8a = 10a. Easy beans. You are happy. This thing is not so hard. You are following it. Very happy.
*3*. Then slowly, you don't see any number again, just letters fighting Jackie Chan on the board; Sin 0/Cos 0 = A/Bx find *x*.... ahan. You vexed!
*4*. You went back to your note, & started thinking, "at what point did I miss it? Why did the teacher eliminate numbers? Why is *"x"* important?"
*5*. You say ok, may be it is just this part. Then the teacher goes, find *x* if α%*¤< + & @%β^ = &^^# *x*. 😳
You ask the teacher, _"please give us a clue Sir"_
*6*. In your head, you are thinking, "how can you tell me to find *x* when I can't even find all the things surrounding *x*?"
*7*. At that point, you start to dream about your blessed and assured *"F"* in WAEC. To avoid it, you look for a friend to explain better to you.
*8*. This time, you didn't even look for the girl you were tripping for to come teach you because this time...u really want to learn
*9*. You remember your parents, the school fees and the "F" you were already dreaming about. You didn't fool yourself. You looked for your guy.
*10*. You even bought that expensive Further Maths text book. That one where after page one, everything else is written in tongues.
*11*. You bought rechargeable lamp. Called your mum to bring more provisions because "I now read at night and I get hungry"
*12*. You mean business. You want to know how ordinary numbers suddenly changed to Chinese language before your eyes.
*13*. Your friend is even kind. He started with BODMAS. He makes you understand nothing in Further Maths is beyond BODMAS. You are happy. Easy.
*14*. After two hours of learning, you got everything. Your friend should be a teacher you thought. He teaches better. Wow! You feel really good!
*15*. Back in the hostel alone, you picked two easy "problems," did wuru wuru to the answer. You checked the back for answer. Yay! You gorrit!
*16*. Back in class, the teacher is not even writing letters that you know again, he has gone Greek on you. Tetha, Beta, Alpha...argh!
*17*. As if that wasn't evil enough, he combines them, "tan _tetha_" "cos _tetha_" and he draws one snake that look like _*S*_ like this.......!!!
*18*. That was the point the *"F"* in your dream became flesh and formed tears on your face. You must call mummy. You know that.
*19*. Then something in you said, don't call her. She will think you are an _*Olodo*_ if you don't do "Science class". So you didn't bother.
*20*. You simply just gave yourself brain. Ran faster than _light_ to see what was happening in *Art Class*
*21*. They were teaching them _"the Macpherson constitution"_ and what made the _"Clifford constitution"_ different.
*22*. Then they spoke about the _"Motion for Independence"_ and the _"1979 constitution."_ You felt at home.
*23*. Next day, you take the Further Maths text books and all the big books like it, over to CMS. *Sell them all !!!* 
LOLzzz 😀!
*24*. This is a true life story of real people who were really brilliant but had no business in "Science Class" but *"had"* to be there... just to form _Alagbará_
*25*. Society insists; smart people are in Science Class. The others join Art Class. This is tragic and really this ought to stop soon!
*26*. There are no dumb people. You are smart at what you thrive at and most of us thrive at something...
*27*. That I can't thrive at what you thrive at doesn't make me dumb. Usain Bolt will outrun LeBron James on the track. But in B'Ball🏀? ..James wins !
*28*. To this day, some of you still judge yourself based on what your friends are achieving. Please, judge yourself against yourself alone!
.......
*30*. Don't make your life like football leagues where you check on the results of others to feel better.


Have a wonderfully wonderful day.

19/06/2020, 08:55 - +234 706 297 4329: Good morning guys, am having a bit of difficulty understanding  feature reduction and extraction and how I can implement them on a given data set to find the optimal features in building a model for making prediction
19/06/2020, 09:12 - +234 708 531 6273: Feature reduction means reducing feature space i.e reducing the number of columns in your dataset to a bearable minimum that won't  impact the model negatively . Let's say I have a data with 500 columns.  This number of columns can be computationally expensive or make it difficult for the model to see patterns in the data. Therefore there is a need to reduce the number of columns to a minimum that won't be computationally expensive or reduce the model's predicting power. 

Using dimensionality(feature) reduction, you can check the percentage of information retained as you reduce the columns in the data set . Usually, 85% to 99% retained information is cool depending on your choice.
19/06/2020, 09:16 - Yusfat: and how would you know you have reduced enough as to not Introducing biases wrt to domain knowledge?

is 85-99% just an intuition or standard? and does choosing it vary or influence interpretation, output or performance?
19/06/2020, 09:16 - +234 706 839 0583: 👍👍👍
19/06/2020, 09:18 - +234 708 531 6273: Feature Extraction will help you generate more columns to improve the model's predicting power. 

There are so many ways you can do this but majorly you need domain knowledge to know which new feature will likely impact the model. 

But for practice, you can combine one or two columns. This is more of a trial and error sontin.

There are so many mathematical methods like taking the exponent or log of a column too
19/06/2020, 09:19 - +234 706 839 0583: This made me remember the first time i did Fmaths in GCE, immediately i saw the questions, i just jejely sleep ni.🤣🤣🤣🤣
19/06/2020, 09:20 - +234 708 531 6273: Out of 500 columns , if you have 450 columns retaining 90% info and 10 columns retaining 85 % info which do you think is better
19/06/2020, 09:20 - Yusfat: 10-85
19/06/2020, 09:21 - Yusfat: aliasing
19/06/2020, 09:21 - +234 708 531 6273: So you see? There is no standard it's just intuition.

19/06/2020, 20:11 - +234 810 878 6913: Pls guys, I want to know. EDA and data cleaning, which one ought to come first?
19/06/2020, 20:12 - Yusfat: Data cleaning
19/06/2020, 20:12 - +234 810 878 6913: 😏😏😏
19/06/2020, 20:12 - Yusfat: Sometimes, it may depend sha

19/06/2020, 20:13 - +234 810 878 6913: Guy, I'm serious here
19/06/2020, 20:18 - Yusfat: from definition, data cleaning helps u modify data to fit the criteria for a specific problem, and you will  av no idea what you might want to change about a data set until you know what's in it...🙄
19/06/2020, 20:19 - Yusfat: no straight answer to ur question though
19/06/2020, 20:19 - Yusfat: wrt this
19/06/2020, 20:20 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright. Thanks
19/06/2020, 20:21 - Yusfat: This message was deleted
19/06/2020, 20:21 - Yusfat: EDA can help u find which variables need more attention to impute the data sets... If i see there is no pattern during bivariate analysis between dependent and independent variable then, its won't make meaning investing time to clean such data at dat stage.
19/06/2020, 20:22 - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm
19/06/2020, 20:33 - Yusfat: For a presentation made back in April

20/06/2020, 16:41 - Yusfat: When ever any new thing is the talk of the town, there will always be people somewhere with the intent of scamming unsuspected ppl...after all, data science skills is very important. Such scam will never stop in crypto, and many will fall for it in the DS industry
20/06/2020, 16:44 - Yusfat: Global for that matter... Well, if people are truly acquired solidified knowledge from the scheme, they may not wana bother wether it's not genuine... provided their #4,000 gave them a satisfactory practical knowledge. 

There are many hidden scams and open scams that we have nothing to do about them...
20/06/2020, 16:48 - Yusfat: Like I once posted some days ago, if you want to know from your personal findings, you could just google search : 

*hash analytics scam* and I am 100% sure *Quora* is one of the platforms where someone must have asked a similar question, and there will always be lots of answers to that - that's what Quora is for: asking and answering questions.

22/06/2020, 14:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 👍
22/06/2020, 14:35 - Obinna Iheanachor: When in doubt, hire analysts before other roles. Appreciate them and reward them. Encourage them to grow to the heights of their chosen career (and not someone else’s). Of the cast of characters mentioned in this story, the only ones that every business needs are decision-makers and analysts. The others you’ll only be able to use when you know exactly what you need them for. Start with analytics and be proud of your newfound ability to open your eyes to the rich and beautiful information in front of you. Data-driven inspiration is a powerful thing.

Too much sense. Thanks for sharing @2348108522573
22/06/2020, 14:36 - Muhammed: ❤️
22/06/2020, 14:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Can you see why AI/ML applications will take time to integrate in Nigeria because many are just coming to understand what Analytics has to offer

22/06/2020, 14:44 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The business is core for any organization anywhere in the world and Analysts and Data scientist with good business Acumen in extension are more valuable.

I recently listened to a podcast in my company of recent where the Google AI team member was talking about how that many AI new frameworks and all most fit more in research and maybe for those with interest to work for Google/FB and the likes that however connecting the tech to the business is what most organization value most not the tech stack which is why I get the point why it's bit challenging integrating many AI propositions and solution
22/06/2020, 14:44 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol .. that's the new advice. In summary:


Build your analytical skills to secure any data related role and don't mind the pay. Excel, POWERBI and SQL.

Learn AI for future when you later run away to explore
22/06/2020, 14:45 - Muhammed: Succinct 👌

22/06/2020, 14:59 - Obinna Iheanachor: Fact is many organizations in Nigeria are still in the infant stage of integrating Enterprise Data Science in their business operations. NLP, Recommendation systems, ML, gbogbo tí gbó no dey their plan. You stand more chance of getting jobs with proficient Excel, Power BI, SQL skills.

Deep learning, ML etc will take some time to become mainstream in Nigeria and Africa as a whole. You stand a better chance of getting jobs with Excel, Power BI, SQL and intermediate Python knowledge.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Better to be proficient in one skill than mediocre in two. In summary, get a good grasp of the basics but still stay curious and explore the complex tools.
22/06/2020, 15:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: E say gbogbo ti gbo 😂😂

I think we focus too much on technical skills and ignore communication and people skills which is very important.

That's why you have people contribute a whole lot in a company and their hard work is barely noticed.

22/06/2020, 20:54 - +234 706 839 0583: It's not religion is pure ignorance
22/06/2020, 20:55 - Yusfat: *Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind* - Albert Einstein
22/06/2020, 20:55 - Yusfat: Lol
22/06/2020, 20:58 - Yusfat: JavaScript starts with J, Jesus

Python is demonic... Ignorance has been attached with religion/faith...
22/06/2020, 20:59 - Muhammed: Religion without science will lead to perdition, science without religion will also lead to perdition. We've got to balance between the both.
22/06/2020, 20:59 - +234 706 839 0583: Ignorance can make one heart hardened ooooo
22/06/2020, 21:05 - +234 817 965 1769: You are correct.

In fact, science should be on the step of religion
22/06/2020, 21:06 - +234 817 965 1769: Religion should be basis for any theory.
22/06/2020, 21:06 - +234 817 965 1769: Blindness in religion or science too isn't good. Just balance it
22/06/2020, 21:07 - Yusfat: But we all have been saying virtually d same thing
22/06/2020, 21:08 - +234 706 839 0583: 👍
22/06/2020, 21:08 - +234 708 531 6273: I disagree. This was how the Roman priests deceived the whole world that the earth is flat . Thanks to Galileo and the likes
22/06/2020, 21:09 - Yusfat: The balancing was what Einstein quote indirectly referred to I think
22/06/2020, 21:09 - +234 817 965 1769: It's not all the religion that said earth is flat.
22/06/2020, 21:09 - +234 817 965 1769: At least Islam that I know said earth isn't flat
22/06/2020, 21:10 - Yusfat: religion must not necessarily b d basis for science bcos it (religion) is flaw in itself ... in some ways
22/06/2020, 21:10 - +234 708 531 6273: Religion is religion irrespective of which you choose . Have religion as the basis of science is so off point
22/06/2020, 21:10 - +234 708 531 6273: *Having
22/06/2020, 21:10 - Yusfat: Wao, exactly my next line of point...

In fact, this is d reason why religion cannot and will never b d basis for any theory..
22/06/2020, 21:11 - Obinna Iheanachor: Is any other person having issues signing in to github?
22/06/2020, 21:11 - +234 817 965 1769: But we still need to justify any theory on the basis of religion for God knows the earth than anybody.


So if one religion made error and another religion confirmed science theory then science need to bow
22/06/2020, 21:12 - Yusfat: maybe some religion said earth is flat n another did not, most scientist in d those days were killed for their scientific beliefs whc contradicted religious beliefs
22/06/2020, 21:13 - +234 817 965 1769: If science theory says A and the two famous religion says B.

Then it's better we balance it
22/06/2020, 21:13 - +234 817 965 1769: Those were the extreme act made by some christains leader then. We don't dispute that
22/06/2020, 21:13 - Muhammed: *Religion is the opium of the masses* ~ Karl Marx
22/06/2020, 21:14 - Yusfat: God knows the earth, does that give us room to know how to use indirect method to search for water, oil and other resources?

Can religion teach us the techniques to get them? 

 God is different from religion... Don't mix things up.

God is the master here... Religion can't stand alone
22/06/2020, 21:14 - +234 708 531 6273: No religion currently practised on earth would have led us to where we are today without those brilliant scientific research and discoveries . 

Religion and Science are two parallel lines. 

Some people will say TV is a since. Some will say education is a sin. Abegi religion is a veil used to rob humans off their vision
22/06/2020, 21:15 - +234 817 965 1769: Scientists do make mistakes too. 


One scientist will dispute another one or modify the existing theory
22/06/2020, 21:15 - +234 708 531 6273: ✅
22/06/2020, 21:15 - +234 708 531 6273: How do we balance it please
22/06/2020, 21:15 - Yusfat: We would be entering psychology to defend some points here...
22/06/2020, 21:15 - +234 817 965 1769: So we won't than conclude that the theory is rubbish
22/06/2020, 21:16 - Yusfat: 🤝🏼
22/06/2020, 21:16 - +234 817 965 1769: And that religion is different from God is another argument
22/06/2020, 21:16 - +234 817 965 1769: Who created religion if not God? Is another question
22/06/2020, 21:17 - +234 817 965 1769: If any religion was created by people then it can't stand test of time
22/06/2020, 21:17 - +234 817 965 1769: But that of God will always stand the test of time
22/06/2020, 21:17 - Yusfat: I chose God over religion
22/06/2020, 21:18 - Muhammed: *God created man, man created religion* 😂😁
22/06/2020, 21:18 - Yusfat: That's normal, even God said In the Quran that human should seek knowledge...
22/06/2020, 21:19 - +234 817 965 1769: And nobody can worship God without attaching himself to religion.

Where will you get the principle to worship him from? Where will you get how to attain his pleasure and paradise? How do you know how to avoid hell?
22/06/2020, 21:20 - +234 708 531 6273: God bless you. 🙏🏻

Seeking God should be our number one priority. Religion is the doctrine of some foreigners . We sef come add our own versions
22/06/2020, 21:20 - Yusfat: There are two types of religions:

1. One created by God

2. Adulterated religion - one modified by human for their selfish interest, to scam congregations... Religious leaders who are only Interested in money and forgo preaching about heaven...
22/06/2020, 21:20 - +234 817 965 1769: So to say God didn't create religion or has nothing to do with religion is hmmm baseless ooo
22/06/2020, 21:21 - +234 817 965 1769: Give us example of the one created by God and that created by foreigners
22/06/2020, 21:21 - Yusfat: WAS THERE ANY RELIGION WHEN GOS CREATED ADAM????
22/06/2020, 21:21 - +234 708 531 6273: Humans created religion. That is why in every religion, you will always find sub groups with slight Variations.
22/06/2020, 21:21 - Yusfat: 🤣
22/06/2020, 21:21 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol... I wished you knew he's joking
22/06/2020, 21:21 - +234 817 965 1769: ??? Please answer this or let's just forget the argument
22/06/2020, 21:22 - +234 817 965 1769: We all have our principle and philosophy
22/06/2020, 21:22 - Muhammed: How do you seek Him without affiliation to a religion?
22/06/2020, 21:22 - Yusfat: Yes, Galileo is no 1... Then maybe Keplee, corpers 😆😆

*Corpenicous* (not corpers🤣🤣)
22/06/2020, 21:23 - Yusfat: I won't want to split this group😆

I would rather not mention bcos I don't blv we shd discuss religion, politics and d likes here
22/06/2020, 21:24 - Yusfat: Kepler*
Johann Kepler
22/06/2020, 21:24 - +234 708 531 6273: Why do you need to affiliate yourself to a religion before seeking God ? 

First man and woman on earth were of which religion?

22/06/2020, 21:26 - Yusfat: When we are done, let me know so as to close the argument with another Einstein's quote 🤣🤣🏃🏃🏃
22/06/2020, 21:26 - Muhammed: I'm a student of *comparative religious study*.

There are different conceptions of God according to different religious beliefs
22/06/2020, 21:28 - +234 817 965 1769: Since you aren't answering this question @2348034445746 and I don't think @2347085316273 wants to help
22/06/2020, 21:29 - Yusfat: Gbayiii.... 

Most of us are of the religion we are into bcos of birth. 

Circumstances make some to convert... Some, it's greed... See, the greatest pastor today could probably have been a Muslim if he was born a Muslim, and the greatest Imam/Alfa could also have probably been a Pastor/Bisho if he was born a Christian...


I lie??
22/06/2020, 21:29 - +234 817 965 1769: Then I say end of discussion
22/06/2020, 21:29 - Muhammed: A free thinker says *doing good is my religion*

An Hindu believes says that *The cow 🐮 is my God*

A Buddhist believes that *Every man is a God*
22/06/2020, 21:29 - +234 708 531 6273: Religion was created for some people to be brought to another people. God that perfectly created heaven and earth with all its galaxies is too divine beyond that. 

He wouldn't create religion for some people while waiting on them to transfer it to some people
22/06/2020, 21:30 - Yusfat: I won't want to split this group😆

I would rather not mention bcos I don't blv we shd discuss religion, politics and d likes here... I gave this response up there
22/06/2020, 21:30 - Yusfat: ☝️
22/06/2020, 21:32 - +234 708 531 6273: No religion was created by God. Humans crafted religion.
22/06/2020, 21:34 - +234 708 531 6273: Religion is a particular system of faith and worship.
22/06/2020, 21:34 - Yusfat: Philosophy
22/06/2020, 21:35 - Yusfat: *
22/06/2020, 21:35 - +234 708 531 6273: Even the holy books of each religion didn't drop mysteriously from heaven. Humans wrote it.
22/06/2020, 21:35 - Muhammed: I can continue to list different religious whatever.

According to the Islamic belief, God said: *Seek me before you worship me, for if you don't know me, how then will you worship me?*

Bible says: *No one gets unto the father, except through me*
22/06/2020, 21:35 - +234 708 531 6273: Through the holy books
22/06/2020, 21:35 - Muhammed: 😁😂😹
22/06/2020, 21:36 - Yusfat: *The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.*

-  Albert Einstein
22/06/2020, 21:36 - Muhammed: Do you belief in those books?
22/06/2020, 21:37 - +234 708 531 6273: I do. 
How has that tied me to a religion?
22/06/2020, 21:38 - Yusfat: *When the solution is simple, God is answering.*

-  Albert Einstein
22/06/2020, 21:39 - Yusfat: *The more I study science. The more I believe in God.* - Albert Einstein
22/06/2020, 21:39 - Muhammed: How do you believe in a book without being affiliated with its source?
22/06/2020, 21:39 - +234 810 878 6913: Pls I need help
22/06/2020, 21:39 - Muhammed: Do you read books on Data Science?
22/06/2020, 21:39 - Yusfat: God is ur helper
22/06/2020, 21:39 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't know what I can't drop columns
22/06/2020, 21:40 - +234 810 878 6913: What could be wrong?
22/06/2020, 21:40 - +234 708 531 6273: No doubt there is God . The problem starts when we humans start attaching him with various religions. Confusion.
22/06/2020, 21:41 - +234 708 531 6273: Affiliate what with which source ? The only connection with man and God is what is written in those books. 
What connection to a source  are you talking about again pls
22/06/2020, 21:41 - Muhammed: How do you know there is God?
22/06/2020, 21:41 - Yusfat: I am but also not confused. I think, I am sitting on d fence
22/06/2020, 21:43 - +234 708 531 6273: Your questions are not driving at anything. Seems pretty random .

How did you know you will die one day ?
How did you know if you don't eat you will die ? 

You questions are sounding like those questions
22/06/2020, 21:44 - Yusfat: Well, from this, does it also mean God confused us by either telling us to serve him, or by not being specific of the religion we should choose??

Are we the one confused or God confused us???

Question based on ur comment.
22/06/2020, 21:44 - Yusfat: My quest is based on ur comment*
22/06/2020, 21:45 - +234 706 839 0583: Hmmmmm this ina discussion 


Me i didn't dey oooo🚶🚶🚶🚶
22/06/2020, 21:45 - Muhammed: How do you believe the content of those books when you know that the books were written by humans?
22/06/2020, 21:46 - Yusfat: 🙆🏻‍♂️🙄😏 ah... The only???
22/06/2020, 21:46 - +234 708 531 6273: Did God tell us what food to eat ? Was he confusing  us by not telling us?
22/06/2020, 21:48 - +234 708 531 6273: Please who wrote the books?
22/06/2020, 21:49 - Yusfat: Probably yes, bcos he knew ahead those that may be poisonous.


There are those that are forbidden, yet God created them (animals like pig 🐖, drinks like alcohol etc), yet God created them...

Why did he create what he doesn't want us to confused???
22/06/2020, 21:50 - Yusfat: us to consume**
22/06/2020, 21:50 - Muhammed: You said the books were written by humans, how do I know who they were?
22/06/2020, 21:50 - Yusfat: 🤣
22/06/2020, 21:50 - Yusfat: he should tell us
22/06/2020, 21:50 - +234 708 531 6273: He was confusing us? 😂😂

Did you just say yes?
22/06/2020, 21:51 - Yusfat: Yes
22/06/2020, 21:52 - Yusfat: Killing is a sin, yet God wanted Abraham to sacrifice his son b4 the replacement with a ram or so... 

It was a test of his faith though, but why put him into confusion, test, or whatever?
22/06/2020, 21:53 - +234 708 531 6273: What exactly is your point? You just keep asking questions that are not in sync with the points being raised . 
Wetin concern me with you knowing who they are ? How has that supported /contradicted the status quo of "Religion should be the basis of science"
22/06/2020, 21:53 - Muhammed: 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
22/06/2020, 21:54 - Muhammed: Actually those with a better grasp of how religion works understands my point, I'm sorry if you don't.
22/06/2020, 21:55 - +234 708 531 6273: I am not here to change your mindset sha. If you think he was confusing you . No Lele . 

My own is that why should Religion be the basis of science .
22/06/2020, 21:55 - Yusfat: Cultists method of using manipulative method to complicate stuffs and confused the audience🤐
22/06/2020, 21:56 - Yusfat: I never said religion shd b d basis for science... U shd shoot me if I say that
22/06/2020, 21:56 - Muhammed: 🙄🙄🙄😁😂

22/06/2020, 21:58 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. 

The point is that you never even had anywhere you were heading to. You just kept asking questions that were not aligning with discus .

I doubt you understand your stance on this matter not talk of your self acclaimed "understanding" of religion
22/06/2020, 21:59 - +234 817 965 1769: They are analogy to the question
22/06/2020, 21:59 - Yusfat: Now that everywhere is settled, I can drop my closing quote
22/06/2020, 22:00 - +234 817 965 1769: It's somehow.

I don't believe that God created religion but I believe there's religious book that teaches me about God
22/06/2020, 22:00 - +234 817 965 1769: How to worship him
22/06/2020, 22:00 - +234 817 965 1769: If religion were fake then anything written in religious book is also fake
22/06/2020, 22:01 - +234 817 965 1769: But I said since no answer to my questions.


Let just continue with data discussion
22/06/2020, 22:01 - +234 817 965 1769: That one is better
22/06/2020, 22:01 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol... More like incongruity
22/06/2020, 22:01 - Yusfat: Thank you all for the knowledge shared.🤝🏼

We always learn from arguments😃😃

Although, no conclusion but someone must have learnt something new even though the admins were supposed to remove us😆😆

Here is my Einstein's quote

22/06/2020, 22:02 - +234 817 965 1769: I am even expecting removal too
22/06/2020, 22:02 - +234 708 531 6273: But we have tons of religion. Are they all true or fake ?

22/06/2020, 22:03 - +234 817 965 1769: But some people are somewhere somehow glancing through it
22/06/2020, 22:03 - Muhammed: Well I'm actually not here to argue, just to test your understanding of religion /God, but it's obvious that we're not operating at the same realm.

My comments are not for everyone to understand, I believe those who are the same level with me or higher level than me understands better.

Do have a wonderful night rest 🥱😴
22/06/2020, 22:03 - Muhammed: Of*

Religious? Data Science? Philosophy? Scientific realm? 


🤷‍♂️. 😆😃🏃🏃🏃
22/06/2020, 22:05 - Muhammed: I'm driving 🚘, I'll reply you when I park.

😂😂😂😂
22/06/2020, 22:06 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Professor of religion/God with so much understanding that he can test how much other people know 😂 😂

It's good to think highly of one's self. Its allowed. Let just hope you understand what you think you understand.
22/06/2020, 22:07 - +234 817 965 1769: Ok ooo

22/06/2020, 22:09 - Muhammed: Well what do Musa like me know?

I'm not thinking high of myself, rather I want you to know that God appears to people in different forms, whether you like it or not, religion is from him. Though no religion holds superiority over the other, it's just a folly of the followers of a religion to believe that they are better than others with differing religious beliefs
22/06/2020, 22:09 - Muhammed: Him*
22/06/2020, 22:11 - +234 708 531 6273: 👍🙌🏽

Its okay for us to hold tight to what we believe in. I wish us all the very best.

Then try again.

24/06/2020, 09:32 - Tosin Openiyi: Wow 😯

Quick work around Bro...

Import the data to sql server & and connect power bi to the table in SQL. Or do your analysis in SQL & Power BI for the visualisation.
24/06/2020, 09:37 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You dig🎯

I will check it out once I finish up what I'm working on.

It didn't even pop my brain to route SQL Server or even try ACL 

Thanks man

30/06/2020, 15:52 - +234 810 878 6913: 10 interview tips for FRESHERS and GRADUATES.

1. Be modest and not cocky. No hiring manager wants to hire a “know-it-all,” but instead someone who is willing to learn.

2. Reassess your digital footprint. Make sure that your digital handles align with who you are and what you want to represent.

3. Choose your words wisely. Speak in a professional manner and leave out any slang – and don’t swear!

4. Don’t be too casual in conversation. This isn’t your pal, but a professional who could ultimately determine your future.

5. Leave desperation at the door. Don’t act desperate for the job. Instead, be “cool, calm, and confident.”

6. Partake in active listening. While interviews are nerve-wracking, make sure you’re actually listening.

7. List relevant experience. Did your classwork, an internship, or a part-time job improve your personal/professional skills?

8. Dress the part. Depending on the work culture, dress in a way that would complement the company, but take it up a notch.

9. Make eye-contact. Whether it’s in-person or remote, be engaging.

10. Shut off your phone or put it in silent mode. No hiring manager wants to hear a phone ring, a text message, or an alert of any kind.

01/07/2020, 09:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Lesson 1 - Don't use WhatsApp visibility make judgement someone is available, it's synonymous to seeing my visibility during the day and assume I'm free, what if I'm engrossed with work and very far away from my phone?

So drop your message and await response, a friend wills say *make excuses for people* , I understand people ignore but I'm sure I am not one, so I will definitely revert though it may not be at your timing.

Thank you
01/07/2020, 09:11 - Yusfat: Lol, @2348108522573 ... 

Yea, you are right though... Sometimes or most time, the network will display the person as online for upto 30 mins to 1 hour (depending) even while they already went offline.

 I am very observant of that... and I had experimented with it many times, and *thinking people are online when they are not* - has put sour into many relationships

01/07/2020, 09:16 - +234 817 965 1769: Not really that. It's normal. The message I sent was per the adjective that it's urgent. So I was like let me get through info on time.

And I think this not the first time somebody will tag anybody in the group saying so and so you aren't responding to your DM or so and so check your DM. And the person will check especially if it's urgent and you Know the person usually receive a lot of DMs that might have pushed the message down

Sometimes people can
01/07/2020, 09:18 - +234 817 965 1769: And sometimes people can sleep while internet connection is active on their device. It's normal too. I do it too.

01/07/2020, 09:21 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol.. you can't be wrong and right at the same time.

You may just be right for being wrong.

01/07/2020, 09:23 - +234 817 965 1769: The truth is most of the time some people attend to group messages before personal message and vice versa.

I will disturb your life till you reply me😂😂.. No time for he is online but not replying me thou i feel bad but it don't affect me disturbing you 🤣 na me want something so i gat makr excuse till you tell me bluntly *get out* even then i fit just give you 2days and i return to disturb you....😂

Through out yesterday i didn't sleep.. So imagine me not responding to a message and the sender is annoyed witg me.. I don't think you should get upset with slow reply..sometimes i reply @opaino @obinna @Muhammed chat late other times i go read and forget to reply and vise verse... I believe they understand..... What i try doing is to start the chat with sorry for slow reply but not always...
01/07/2020, 09:31 - Yusfat: You 😂

Your own tire me... Long chat, u replied *ok* I come dey think say "wetin dey do dis broz"😂😂

Most times he is usually busy and may not respond fast especially on WhatsApp but I know where to chat him and he will reply immediately🤪

Opiano na nice guy always ready to help data gurus and enthusiasts🔥😘
01/07/2020, 12:11 - Muhammed: Just as you know that it might take forever for me to respond to my messages sometimes. Seeing someone online is not a metric to judge their availability. Often time, my data is on, but reality is that the phone is kinda far from me, so I might not get to reply your messages, pick your calls or return the call on time.

I reply to messages on some other platforms faster than I do on Whatsapp. @2348034445746 is a witness that I don't reply to messages on time.

So let's not make and issue out of that, and let's not judge a person's availability by their online status.

01/07/2020, 21:02 - +234 816 170 8710: The worst algorithm interview I ever had (and a tutorial to learn from my mistake) -



Faisal, it's Nate from newline and I completely bombed an interview right out of the gate.

"So Nate," my interviewer asked me, "could you write me an algorithm to find the nth prime number?"

Total. Brain. Freeze. I take a deep breath and try to get unstuck. But nothing's coming to me.

My brain starts running, silently:

"Isn't this a really hard problem, and what they use for cryptography?""I guess I can just loop through every number in order and check if it's prime? There's no way that's the final answer, but maybe that's a good start?""How do you check for a prime number in code anyway? Do I have to write a factorization algorithm? How do you even do that??""What's the definition of a prime number again? Ugh, how do I not know that. This should be so simple.""He's wondering why I'm being so quiet. I should say something. AHHHHH"

At this point, I just start sneezing. The worst sneezing fit of my life. (I've never stress-sneezed before or since.)

My interviewer: "Are you okay?"

Me: "Yeah, I'm fine. Let's do this."

Interviewer: "You know, we could reschedule and do this at a different time when you're feeling better?"

Me: "We could do this tomorrow, but I'm not going to be any smarter by then. Let's just end this now."

And we cut the interview short and I died inside.

This was completely avoidable if I had prepared a little better.

What could I have done instead?

It turns out, the algorithm he was looking for was The Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is an algorithm that comes up pretty early when you start studying algorithms.

I didn't have a CS-degree and hadn't studied how to generate prime numbers.

I was a perfectly capable developer and, once I'd taken the time to study the ideas, I realized that finding primes wasn't that hard. But it wasn't my programming skill per-se that was the problem:

It was my lack of preparation that cost me the job.

Faisal, this doesn't have to happen to you.

I can't teach you all of algorithms in one email, but I can at least show you the solution that would have helped me.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes

So, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to some max number n.

And its invention is attributed to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, an ancient Greek mathematician who lived around 200 BC. This algorithm had been around for over 2,000 years but I had never heard of it.

Eratosthenes, giving students a sneezing fit for 2,000 years (src, Wikipedia)

How the Sieve works

The idea is that you iteratively "mark" all of the numbers that you know aren't prime. Here's an animation:

Animation of how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works (src, Wikipedia)

Here it is in JavaScript (with explanation below):

/** * @param {number} maxNumber * @return {number[]} */ export default function sieveOfEratosthenes( maxNumber ) { const isPrime = new Array(maxNumber + 1) .fill(true); isPrime[0] = false; isPrime[1] = false; const primes = []; for ( let number = 2; number <= maxNumber; number += 1 ) { if (isPrime[number] === true) { primes.push(number); let nextNumber = number * number; while (nextNumber <= maxNumber) { isPrime[nextNumber] = false; nextNumber += number; } } } return primes; } 

It works like this:

Create a boolean array of n + 1 positions (to represent the numbers 0 through n)Set positions 0 and 1 to false, and the rest to trueStart at position p = 2 (the first prime number)Mark as false all the multiples of p (that is, positions 2 * p, 3 * p, 4 * p... until you reach the end of the array)Find the first position greater than p that is true in the array. If there is no such position, stop. Otherwise, let p equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 4

When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining true in the array are all the primes below n.

Is this a good interview question?

Is asking this a "good" interview question? I suppose it depends on the job. But, to me, it still feels like a bit of a "trick" question where you either know the trick or you don't.

But when you're interviewing that doesn't matter.

The job you want probably doesn't have a perfect interview process -- if you want the job, learning algorithms is a game you have to play.

Fortunately, there are resources you can use to study! I'll tell you more about one we've been working on later this week.

-- Nate

P.S. It turns out, the sneezing-fit interview wasn't actually my worst interview ever. My worst ever interview involved working on one algorithm problem with an interviewer for over 6-hours - my wife called my parents because she thought I'd been kidnapped. But that's a story for a different day

The boardroom cannot make informed decisions if data isn’t properly visualized to them.

You might ask, what does it take to help the management make informed decisions after your analysis as a Data Analyst.

Great Data Visualization does that for you.

And, what makes up for a great visualization?

- A clear question: Here, every form of ambiguity is tossed into the bin. ‘Cause if your audience isn't in the know of the question you’re trying to answer, then your visualization will be questioned.

Everyday constant noise!!! How do you even seive through all that noise in your own head? 

Please desist from all the noise and help make this group sane, don't be disturbing people's notification with things that are annoying and totally irrelevant.😠

I will of course stop commenting but rather apply ur emotional intelligence when next u want to tackle me... I sieve through the noise with sieve of eratosthenes.

I saw this coming bcos my intuition doesn't deceive me. I do understand where and why this is coming beyond the stated reasons.

D* only favour I would need from you is feel free to kick me out if you are an admin or tell them to

Thank you for your simultaneously meaningful and nonsense approach of presentation.

Be rest assured of this as my last comment but next time re-read All I wrote to know how to present your words!

You've only resorted in this manner and continued for long because the admin is silent about it and even your friends here are not advising you well. 

Be careful! This is the first and last time I want to use such words here.

03/07/2020, 10:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Good morning fam,

Apologies to both persons if offended. However, in as much as discussions outside data which isn't in the scope of this group are welcome so as to help build personal relationship and network outside the formality of "learning or motivating one another" because everything isn't all about the technical skills, you need people and you don't know who you might have build casual relationship with here outside the data talks.

That said, I also understand that the group get spammed at times with incoherent and irrelevant messages which can make someone lose vital informations when they are shared, hence I will recommend this;

✓ Before sharing or dropping anything, do a personal check to know you aren't spamming the group  

N:B; This doesn't rule out other thoughtful and mentally engaging discussions 

✓ Individual will have to learn some emotional intelligence to just overlook in some instances because the truth is sometimes spamming may arise once a while and the only way to curb that will be to  put in place strigent measures such as ; removing spammers, only admin can message etc. which I believe hasn't gotten to that level of spamming

@2348034445746  I do understand you are trying to keep the group alive and we can't afford to lose such energy you bring to the group with your activeness, but please consider some of us once a while 😂, I dey feel your vibe so don't leave us alone 

Beyond learning and deriving motivation from a data Community one thing you can and should leverage on from such is networking and building personal relationship outside the community which oftentimes start off from casual discussions on the group, so let's apply some wisdom and avoid quarrel because na bag all of us want to secure na why we come here.

Danke!

Ope.

*_"Impact of missing data on bias and precision when estimating change in patient-reported outcomes from a clinical registry”_*

If you have been looking at what missing data looks like in survey. This my review helps explain the paper in a shorter time. 

I enjoyed reading this paper due to the *exhaustive* analysis approach. 😄

04/07/2020, 13:28 - +234 703 344 8466: Data science is for those who are interested in generating insightful information and predictions with data.. Focus is on machine learning and deep learning too.

Data engineering is more like advanced database management where you create pipelines and manage data storage or warehouses. You basically ensure that the data gets to the data scientists fast and unhindered.

Data storytelling focuses on visualisations, descriptive statistics.. Basically telling a story that is hidden in the data.

08/07/2020, 12:06 - +234 703 344 8466: Hello guys. Please can anyone enlighten me on what confusion matrix is?
08/07/2020, 12:28 - Francis Atoyebi: It's a matrix that will actually confuses you if you are not careful.
 But it's just a way to look at your classifiers performance on a test set... It shows what was classified correctly or wrongly for the various class you have.
08/07/2020, 12:33 - Francis Atoyebi: On the matrix we have true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives... I pray I don't make mistakes while defining them.

TP or true positives are the class predictions for the positive case that were correct let's say a dog cat classifier if the algo classifies dogs correctly we can say it's true positive.

TN - are the classes that are negative and the classifier classifies correctly using the example above this will mean the cats that were classified as cats.

FP - are the negatives that the classifier classified as positive same example these will be cats that the algo classified as dogs

FN - are positives that the classifier classifies as negative same example these will be the number of dogs that are classified as cats...
08/07/2020, 12:34 - Francis Atoyebi: You can derive a number of metric from your confusion matrix such as recall, accuracy and precision.
08/07/2020, 12:34 - Francis Atoyebi: I'm scared here, you can Google the FP, FN, TP and TN cos as I said earlier it can actually confuse you.
08/07/2020, 12:35 - +234 810 878 6913: You're not far from the truth
08/07/2020, 12:35 - +234 810 878 6913: How?

there are formula for the rest as well

08/07/2020, 12:55 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Base on the metric you have chosen to evaluate your performance on.
08/07/2020, 12:57 - Yusfat: Yeap,

Error rate = (FP + FN)/ P+N
08/07/2020, 12:57 - Yusfat: Accuracy = (TP+TN)/P+N
08/07/2020, 12:57 - Yusfat: Sensitivity = TP/P
08/07/2020, 12:58 - Yusfat: precision = TP/(TP+FP)
08/07/2020, 12:59 - +234 810 878 6913: Confusion matrix or accuracy?
08/07/2020, 13:13 - Francis Atoyebi: @2348034445746 thank you for the formula
08/07/2020, 13:14 - Francis Atoyebi: Just check the classification report instead of the confusion matrix, with classification report, you'll get the accuracy, precision and recall already calculated and I think you will see the matrix too.
08/07/2020, 13:15 - +234 810 878 6913: Code to get the clarification report pls

08/07/2020, 17:05 - +234 816 062 6971: Please what do you guys think about receiving a mail from a Gmail account introducing you to a remote contract job and asking you to sign an NDA if interested? And you have no idea about the person or firm that sent it.
08/07/2020, 17:07 - +234 810 878 6913: What's NDA pls?
08/07/2020, 17:08 - +234 816 062 6971: Non Disclosure Agreement
08/07/2020, 17:09 - +234 903 881 9790: Simply put, you must not tell anyone ( who can benefit from the information)  about it .
08/07/2020, 17:09 - +234 816 677 6236: It sound dodgy, at least the person should introduce themselves and tell what they need from you
08/07/2020, 17:10 - +234 816 062 6971: Thanks
08/07/2020, 17:10 - +234 816 677 6236: Before asking you to sign a NDA
08/07/2020, 17:10 - +234 816 677 6236: But if you must please read properly
08/07/2020, 17:11 - +234 816 062 6971: Exactly, I have done some background research on LinkedIn and Google using substrings from the email address and I didn’t find anything useful
08/07/2020, 17:11 - +234 816 677 6236: 👍
08/07/2020, 17:12 - +234 903 881 9790: Write to to them that they should open up if they want to have any thing to do with you.
08/07/2020, 17:12 - +234 816 677 6236: Because I know no decent company, would ask for this without a proper intro and also asking certain question of you
08/07/2020, 17:13 - +234 816 677 6236: And also explaining what the NDA is for
08/07/2020, 17:13 - +234 816 062 6971: I have just seen the CEO’s name beneath the NDA, I forgot to check their earlier. I will continue my findings/investigation from there before even responding.
08/07/2020, 17:14 - +234 816 677 6236: 👍
08/07/2020, 17:14 - +234 816 062 6971: *there
08/07/2020, 17:14 - +234 816 062 6971: Exactly.
08/07/2020, 17:17 - +234 816 062 6971: I have confirmed who the CEO is, I saw the person’s profile before from my substring search but the company name was not exactly stated in his profile. Thanks guys 🙏🏽
08/07/2020, 17:17 - +234 816 677 6236: 👍
08/07/2020, 17:17 - +234 816 677 6236: All the best

08/07/2020, 17:36 - Jenny: Hi guys, pls how do I fill this up. I checked and found out the country name in the shape file(power bi)  is not exactly as it is in the data set. 

I tried renaming the country name in the json file and refreshing, nothing still. Plus is it possible to zoom into the map?
08/07/2020, 17:37 - +234 816 502 5257: What did you use to plot the map
08/07/2020, 17:37 - +234 816 502 5257: Lat and long
08/07/2020, 17:37 - +234 816 502 5257: Or country name
08/07/2020, 17:38 - Jenny: Country namr
08/07/2020, 17:39 - +234 816 502 5257: The name you used in plotting is not the one showing on the map
08/07/2020, 17:39 - +234 816 502 5257: A different country or a different name
08/07/2020, 17:39 - +234 816 502 5257: Is the problem name or wrong location of the country
08/07/2020, 17:40 - Jenny: Yup, i know... how do I correct it. I tried editing the shape file and refreshing but that didn’t work
08/07/2020, 17:42 - +234 816 502 5257: Close the whole app
08/07/2020, 17:42 - +234 816 502 5257: And restart
08/07/2020, 17:45 - Jenny: It didn't work
08/07/2020, 17:54 - Tosin Openiyi: You've got to be 100% sure the renaming you did in the json file is 💯 accurate.....

I detest it when recruiters don't get back to me. 

I don't even know what went wrong, how much more to make improvements.
09/07/2020, 13:15 - Yusfat: Yea, they preach Emotional Intelligence but fail to realize they ain't practicing it...
09/07/2020, 13:16 - Yusfat: EQ is about awareness (be it self or social worever), they usually omit that feedback maybe due to laziness or feeling bossy🤷‍♂️
09/07/2020, 13:16 - Yusfat: number of applicants can be overwhelming most times though
09/07/2020, 13:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It is what it is.

It's not a Nigerian thing but global, so when applying you apply with 50/50 & little hopes, apply and gboju.

It's can be frustrating 😒 for fresh grad which I can relate but trust me when you are applying for maybe a change of role or job, the tension or frustration won't be there and whether they revert or not won't give you headache.

Life no balace
09/07/2020, 13:28 - Yusfat: Lol, Opiano you alwt defend these people.

This is not about frustration... It is what it is.


 Anyways, I will pick one thing from your last line and throw it in now...

Completing an online course can be hard but if you have say a 40 hours course to complete:

- Squeeze in 2 hours weekdays.
- Sacrifice 3 hours weekends.
- Monday - Friday = 10Hrs
- Saturday & Sunday = 6Hrs

If consistently adhered to, course will be completed in about 3 Weeks.

The Harvard courses are free no doubt, but some require a fee to get the certificate after completion.

I mean, who wouldn't want to put Harvard on their resume?

Regardless, if you are after the knowledge you can invest time into it.

Good luck! #StaySafe

10/07/2020, 16:19 - Yusfat: Prof. Abletor Sedofia from University of Ghana has this to say to us: 
*"Academic excellence is overrated! I said it. Being top of your class does not necessarily guarantee that you will be at the top of life. You could graduate as the best student in Finance but*
*it doesn't mean you will make more money than everybody else. The best graduating Law student does not necessarily become the best lawyer. The fact is life requires more than the ability to understand a concept,* *memorise it and reproduce it in an exam. School rewards people for their memory. Life rewards people for their imagination.*
*School rewards caution, life rewards daring. School hails those who live by the rules. Life exalts those who break the rules and set new ones. So do I mean people shouldn't study hard in school? Oh, no, you should.* *But don't sacrifice every other thing on the altar of First Class.*
*Don't limit yourself to the classroom. Do something practical. Take a leadership position. Start a business and fail.* *That's a better Entrepreneurship 101.Join or start a club. Contest an election and lose. It will teach you something Political Science 101 will not teach you.* *Attend a seminar. Read books outside the scope of your course.* *Go on*
*missions and win a soul for eternal rewards... Do something you believe in! Think less of* *becoming an excellent student but think more of becoming an excellent person. Make the world your classroom."*

*Good morning, Great Minds*

10/07/2020, 20:50 - +234 703 036 1587: I guess this is a classification problem
10/07/2020, 20:50 - +234 703 036 1587: Check for the recall rate, precision and F1 score
10/07/2020, 20:52 - +234 703 036 1587: You can also plot a normalised value of the confusion matrix to see what fractions of the classes where correct and what wasn't correct
10/07/2020, 20:53 - +234 703 036 1587: Peardventure there is a class imbalance or the classes are not really separable. You can tow the option of evaluating the RC scores

10/07/2020, 20:54 - +234 810 878 6913: Yes, it is
10/07/2020, 20:55 - +234 703 036 1587: Now to the second question. Why accuracy?

Now you've trained a model with your train set. Using a test set data on that model will help tell you what percentage of the data point was correctly classified.
10/07/2020, 20:55 - +234 810 878 6913: Syntax pls🙏🏽🙏🏽
10/07/2020, 20:56 - +234 810 878 6913: Thanks
10/07/2020, 20:56 - +234 703 036 1587: Using accuracy alone can be misleading. As there is  possibility of getting a dominant correctly and not the other smaller classes hence the need to use other measures.
10/07/2020, 20:57 - +234 703 036 1587: I guess you are using scklearn?

10/07/2020, 20:57 - +234 810 878 6913: Like?

11/07/2020, 14:50 - Yusfat: DESPERATION WILL MAKE YOU LOSE WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GAINED
In 2012, I won the Commonwealth Shared Scholarship (CSS) together with about 60 Nigerians, to pursue a Master's degree in the UK.
Among us was a young guy (not more than 23 years old) whose real name I will withhold (let’s call him, James); studying at King’s College London at the time.
By September/October 2013, we had all completed our Master's degrees successfully and the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC) were preparing to book our flights back to Nigeria, as Commonwealth scholars are mandated to return to their home countries at the end of the award.
On arriving at Lagos Nigeria, James spent just 48 hours in the country and returned to the UK on the 3rd day of arrival. He told the UK Border officials at the Heathrow Airport in London that although he had officially graduated, he is yet to do his convocation which is why he returned.
When he was asked why he left the UK in the first place, he said his mother was gravely ill and he had to rush back home to support her emotionally. The official noticed he was only in Nigeria for 2 days but since it had to do with family, he was allowed into the country. Plus, his visa was still valid till February 2014 so they had no strong reason to deny him entry.
He returned to his apartment in London and started plotting a desperate plan to never return to Nigeria. He was introduced into the “fake marriage with a Brit” route and was assigned a “White British fiancee" who was to be paid for the job for a specific length of time.
They successfully deceived the British authorities in the first year during which they got married and began to live together as a couple. He got his PR permit and was working at an IT firm in London, doing excellently well for himself and hoping to be granted full citizenship in due time.
By 2016, the whole plan failed when he had a terrible argument with his fake wife which got really loud and messy. The neighbours overheard her screaming on top of her voice that he should pay her for the last 2 months he owed or else she would report him to the authorities and they will drag his ass back to Nigeria. As expected, one of the neighbours called the Police.
He was eventually deported after 2 weeks of investigation. And this suddenly turned his life upside down because he would never be able to return to the UK again. Even his unborn kids may have a problem getting into the UK in the future if they state in their visa application forms that he is their father.
To make the situation worse, the UK Border Agency reported him to the CSC, and the CSC immediately expunged his name from the list of past scholars in the CSC scholars online directory and officially withdrew all post-award benefits and privileges.
His desperation never to return to Nigeria despite winning a scholarship that mandates him to do so, made him lose all he had gained. He was a First-class graduate from a credible Federal University in Nigeria and was fortunate enough to win the extremely competitive CSS to study at a globally-renowned University in the UK. He ruined everything he had achieved because he was desperate and short-sighted.
He wrote himself off and thought poorly of what he could have achieved even in Nigeria. Plus, who says he couldn't legitimately leave the country later perhaps for further studies on another scholarship, just as many of us who won the CSS together with him back in 2012 later did for our PhDs. He simply wrote himself off. Quite sad.
We have not heard from him since he was deported in 2016. His number isn't reachable and he is no longer active on all his social media platforms. I only hope he is safe, learned his lessons and planning to bounce back quietly. I do sincerely wish him well.
While I do understand the need for continuous professional growth in a thriving environment, a decent Nigerian should learn to choose legitimate routes to glory.
It has to be legitimate.
It has to have no horrible consequences.
So that you can sleep with your eyes closed while those in Nigeria follow you daily and call you mentor!
Some of you might say in your minds, “it is because he was caught; how about countless number of Nigerians who did it successfully and are now enjoying their lives in the abroad?” The fact that they were not caught doesn't make the act right. It remains a very dangerous route with damning consequences which must be avoided at all cost!
Again, let me reiterate: “Do not sacrifice integrity at the altar of ambition. Your acclaimed success will always be in question.”
A word is enough for the wise.

15/07/2020, 02:17 - +234 806 058 7948: *IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW CBN POLICY OF GSI*

The CBN yesterday released a new policy called GSI (Global Standing Instruction). The policy is a very welcome policy. Below,  i try to summarize the major points of the policy. 

1. It applies to all financial institutions in the country.

2. If you take a loan in any bank (say GTB)  and you refuse to pay back, we would look for any other bank(s) in the country (say Access bank, and Sterling bank) where you have accounts and there is money, we would take the money from those accounts and pay GTB back. 
E.g you take 30k Loan from GTB and you fail to pay back. You have 10k in your Access bank account, 15k in your Sterling bank joint account with your wife and 8k in your child's First bank account that you help her manage (because she is still a minor). We would sweep the 15k in your Sterling bank joint account with your wife, sweep the 10k in your Access Bank, and take 5k out of the 8k you have in your child's First Bank account. We would send them all to GTB. The remaining 3k in your child's First Bank account  would not be touched. That's a promise. 😉😉

3. Even if its a joint account that your BVN is found on,  money would be moved from there!  

4. If we find out that you have an account that we should have moved money from but you have done chua-chua to not put your bvn on that account, then your BVN would be watchlisted. My brother, that is a major gbege!  You are finished!

5. Only principal and interest would be swept from your other accounts. Penalty charges would  not be included. CBN don try for us o. 😀😀

6. If a bank wrongfully activates GSI on you (you have not defaulted on your loan and they go make the system sweep from your other accounts) , the bank would pay a fine of 500k sharparly. No begging. 

7. If you complain about a wrongful activation of GSI on your accounts, and the bank claims you are wrong, you then decide to request for arbitration. If the arbiter rules that you are correct, then the bank pays a fine of 10M. No story! 

The GSI becomes effective from August 1st 2020.

This helps the system to fight serial loan defaulters and allows banks to more readily give out loans. As a matter of fact, a bank can now choose to give you a loan without you previously having an account with the bank. 

It's a new dawn in our country.

15/07/2020, 11:21 - +234 816 170 8710: PONDER OVER THIS...

I am on a path today that isn't in accordance with my academic discipline.

I pursue a course today that isn't coherent with the topics that accorded me a degree certificate.

I'm currently building a career that in no way relates to my academic qualifications.

In the past 8 years, I have worked with over 5 establishments, that are in no way related to my academic discipline.

My Academic certificate did not qualify me for most jobs I've had.

It was skills, knowledge and desire that landed me the offers.

I have had job offers I didn't actually apply for.

How did it come about?

I'll be straight up honest with you.

It was via my social media activities.

People are watching.

The stuff you post, the information you disperse, your profile picture, your cover photo, your personal info, the comments you leave... 

You may not know, but these things add up.

These days, recruiters would visit your social media page.

People who offer grant would run a digital profile on you.

It has become a criteria, just so you know.  

I'm not surprised that my academic certificate has not done much for me, financially (since I left school) as far as I'm concerned.

I believe I will put my degree to a good use soon.

I definitely would try something.

If you're currently in the university, please do all you can to finish and finish strong.

If you're planning to go to the university, please do it.

Dont listen to people who talk down on formal education.

This is Nigeria...

You're already at a disadvantage, by world standards.

Don't add to your woes.

However, let me reveal to you what our current reality is... 

It is a total waste of formal Education to go to school with the sole aim of landing a good job when you graduate.

Not with this government.

Not in this current world economy.

Not anymore.

It is a complete rape of academic intelligence and God given wisdom to hang your hope around our government for job provision and improved personal living.

Wake up and smell the coffee, my dear friend.

Emeka that charged you 15k to repair your phone is not doing it with his certificate.

Tolu that charges over 15k to repair laptops at computer village is not a university graduate.

John that charged your church 20k for the graphics design of crusade posters is not a graduate of computer science.

Stanley that build websites for small businesses did not study computer science in the university.

Nekky that charged Cynthia 80k for her wedding makeup never saw the four walls of the university.

Damilola that makes over 150k monthly from  her beauty salon is a graduate of Geology, not beauty-ology

Naomie that makes customized tees for organizations did not study that in the university.

Mmesomma that was paid 150k to paint the house you currently live in, does not even have a BSc yet.

Those pair of shoe on your feet were made by Ebuka in Aba.

Ebuka is a graduate of Mass Communications. He never studied shoe making in school.

Wizkid did not study music in school, that is, if he even finished schooling.

You're cruising around town with your Lexus ride, jollofing everyday with different  ladies and friends.

James your neighbour who's a civil engineer, has the same type of car too and he uses his to make over 200k monthly on Uber.

Wait...

Am I ranting?

What's the fuse about?

You think it's by certificate?

Well, you may be right but it works for just a little fraction of the population. 

This is not to say that formal education is not good. Of course not!

Formal education actually gives you wings but it does not help you to fly.

The onus is on you to spread your wings and fly.

How high you fly is your own doing.

Formal education may be a factor that facilitates the processes of attaining greatness but it's not a yardstick for success.

It's never too late to acquire a skill, my dear friend.

You may forget the definition of bryophyta.

You may never remember the colour of ethanol.

You may not be able to identify H2SO4 by it's smell...

But guess what?

You'll never forget how to drive a car even if you stop driving for 5 years.

You'll never forget how to hit the hammer on a nail.

You'll never forget how to barb.

You'll never forget how to tile the floor.

You'll not forget how to paint.

You'll never  forget how to bake cakes.

You'll never forget how to make small chops.

The need for knowledge and skill acquisition in Self-Development and economic growth can never be over emphasised.

Wake up and smell the coffee, my dear friend.

Wake up and smell the coffee.

18/07/2020, 16:13 - Yusfat: *7 REASONS WHY DEGREE HOLDERS ARE POOR?*

BASICALLY, there seven reasons why degree holders are poor.

*1. THEY DON’T THINK BEYOND THEIR CERTIFICATES*

Albert Einstein said, *"Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think*.” Have you ever heard creativity term “Think outside the box”? One of the major reasons why most graduates are poor is simply because they can’t see and think beyond their certificates. 
I have seen engineering students work as bankers. I have seen medical doctors with great skills in web and graphic designs. I have seen lawyers that are very dexterous with finances. There are also psychology students who delve into data science. The list is endless!

The basic truth of life is that the skills that are needed to be much sought after and become more successful in life are not really found within the walls of the classrooms. Your certificate is just a proof that you are teachable, it does not suggest what you are totally capable of doing. You are full of possibilities when you think beyond your degrees and certificates.

*2. THEY PRIORITIZE THEIR CERTIFICATES MORE THAN THEIR GIFTS AND TALENTS*

I have often advised some of my colleagues, never to leave their gifts dormant while pursuing and hunting for jobs with their certificates. There must be a complementary balance in the pursuit of your passion and in the search for jobs.

Everybody is gifted for something, but the winning edge comes from our ability to work on our gifts and bless the world with it. The very best way to develop yourself is in the direction of your natural talents and interest. In order to live a fulfilled and impactful life, we need to work harder on our gift than our job. We need to discover our gift, develop it, and sell it. Don’t bury your TALENT with your certificates.

*3. THEIR CERTIFICATES PREPARE THEM FOR A WORLD THAT NO LONGER EXIST*

It has been found that most of the skills taught in schools are becoming obsolete in the present world. The world has changed a lot, and so are people’s need! It is imperative to know that the present form of university education does not prepare students for the future.

Graduates are becoming endangered species in the face of a changing world. Our archaic methods and approaches of learning are preparing graduates for a world that no longer exist, as we are churning out degree holders every year with certificates that have face value but no intrinsic worth. Most learning institutions are filled up with lecturers and pseudo-educators with lecture notes, methods and approaches that have lost relevance in a changing world.

*4. THEY KNOW LESS ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT MORE ABOUT THINGS*

Certificates and degrees don’t reveal people to themselves; they at most measure our IQ (Intelligent Quotient). I have often tell people that there is no Recovery without Discovery. A poor man is simply someone that has not discovered himself.

The more you discover yourself, the more you realize the treasures that are hidden deep within you. We carry inside ourselves latent treasures that can only be unveiled through self-discovery.

*5. CERTIFICATES AND DEGREES CAN KILL INITIATIVES*

Degrees and certificates can close up your minds to ideas while initiatives open it up. If you are not careful, your degrees and certificates can close up your mind. The purpose of education is to keep your mind perpetually opened towards limitless possibilities!

Fred Smith saw an opportunity for overnight delivery of anything anywhere in the USA, and ultra- fast delivery anywhere in the world, FedEx was born. It will be interesting to know that Fred Smith got a grade “C” in a Yale economics class for an idea that the professor belittled as unworkable. 
Fred Smith’s company became the first American business to make over ten billion dollars in annual profit. Beginning with just 186 packages delivered the first night, FedEx now delivers in over two hundred countries using over 6,030 aircraft, 46,000 vehicles and 141,000 employees.

*6. DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES POSITION YOU TO LOOK FOR JOBS AND NOT FOR OPPORTUNITIES*

Our certificates and degrees prepare graduates to look for jobs and not open our eyes to life-changing opportunities. You are not poor because you don’t have a job; you are poor because you are not seeing and seizing opportunities.

Being POOR is simply Passing Over Opportunities Repeatedly! What keeps people ahead in life is not their education or degrees, it is simply the opportunity that they seized. Jobs may be scarce but not opportunities.

As long as there is a problem to be solved, there will always be opportunities. It is a waste of our education, exposure, and experiences if after we graduate from school, all we think about is searching for a job. An enlightened and educated mind should be able to see and seize opportunities.

*7. CERTIFICATES AND DEGREES PREPARE PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR SECURITY AND NOT TO TAKE RISKS*

We must be willing to make mistakes and take breakthrough risks. Taking risks and learning from mistakes help us in knowing what works and what does not! When Thomas Edison was being questioned by a mischievous journalist on how he felt for having failed for 999 times before getting the idea of the light bulb, his response stunned the whole world when he confidently said, “I have not failed 999 times, I have only learned 999 ways of how not to make a light bulb”.

I ALSO REMEMBER ONE OF THOMAS EDISON's quotes that says: *"TOMORROW IS MY EXAM BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER CAN'T DECIDE MY FUTURE.*😂😂

Many graduates and degree holders are becoming progressively poor because the skills required in the modern world to get rich are not taught in schools and institutions.

By 2025, we’ll lose over five million jobs to automation. This means that future jobs will look vastly different by the time many people graduate from the university.

*Future jobs will involve KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION/CREATION* and innovation, and people that are only equipped with skills found in the classroom will definitely be a misfit in an ever-changing world. Skills like critical thinking, creativity, people’s skill, STEM skills (e.g Coding), complex problem-solving skills etc. are central to living a more comprehensive and productive life.

*8 THEREFORE,* in conclusion, My humble and candid advice to graduates and students in institutions is to think wide, deep and outside the box. Take volunteer jobs, and don’t be afraid to navigate fields that are different from your field of learning. Your future career will require you to pull information from many different fields to come up with creative solutions to future problems. 
Start by reading as much as you can about anything and everything that interests you. Once you get to college, consider double majoring or minoring in completely different fields. Trust me, it’ll pay off in the long run.

Don’t limit yourself to the classroom. Do something practical. Take a leadership position. Start a business and fail; that’s a better entrepreneurship. Contest an election and lose. It will teach you something political science will not teach you. Attend a seminar. Read books outside the scope of your course.

Think less of becoming an excellent student, but think more of becoming an excellent person. Don’t make the classroom your world, but make the world your classroom. Step forward and try something extra.

Invest in something you believe! Real financial security and freedom is not in your job, but in your passion, gifts, talents, and your ability to see and seize opportunities.

18/07/2020, 16:54 - +234 812 216 8133: 1. Interest can change. Same way you a well trained GEOPHYSICIST is pitching his tent in DS. 

2. And 3 looks spot on

5. I agree with you.

18/07/2020, 16:56 - Yusfat: Because Albert Einstein's quote was there doesn't mean I drafted the write up ooo... Na copy and paste ooo😂😂
I only modified it, 1%
18/07/2020, 16:57 - +234 812 216 8133: I am sure you modified the DS part. 

Well since you shared it, it meant it resonated with you
18/07/2020, 16:58 - Yusfat: 🙄 seriously I copied it, and am not saying that bcos of the criticisms... I knew seeing Einstein would make ppl think it originated from me... I don't really have time to write epistle for now...
18/07/2020, 16:58 - Yusfat: 😂😂
18/07/2020, 16:59 - Yusfat: Like resonant frequency right?🤪

18/07/2020, 17:06 - +234 810 878 6913: I don't understand
18/07/2020, 17:07 - Yusfat: Too generalized though..., 

4. Self-discovery really goes a long way in everything we do, but luckily some people make it by chance w/o necessarily discoverying much about themselves and things are working out fine for them, at least. 

However, many too have discovered themselves, yet the economy is still turturing/totoring them...
18/07/2020, 17:09 - +234 812 216 8133: Too much iwé
18/07/2020, 17:10 - Yusfat: I no fit enter whining
18/07/2020, 17:10 - +234 812 216 8133: 🤣🤣

Your last paragraph is the reality of many Nigerians.
18/07/2020, 17:26 - Yusfat: Ur brother dey other group dey blow grammar... Crap 🦀 crab
18/07/2020, 18:23 - +234 812 989 8929: I am really amazed at how some people can call another person's write up *crap* here. 

You could have criticised with a high level of maturity.

I found Elements of truth in the write up, I think...we just can't run away from the facts.

 It also preaches (indirectly) why some of us (like me with Microbiology background) should embrace Data Science...
18/07/2020, 18:39 - Yusfat: Data Science/ML is really madly useful in Geophysics. There hardly anything I delve into that doesn't inter-relate with my other areas of interest...no matter how subtle.

Google partnered with Total to utilize the potential of Machine Learning for optimizing oil and gas well drilling and for decision making.
18/07/2020, 18:42 - Yusfat: ExxonMobil and Microsoft also partner to utilize the power of big data technology for *enhancement of oil recovery* etc.
18/07/2020, 18:44 - Yusfat: The is part of the statements... 

The application of Microsoft technologies by ExxonMobil’s XTO Energy subsidiary – including Dynamics 365, Microsoft Azure, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things – is anticipated to improve capital efficiency and support Permian production growth by as much as 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2025.

19/07/2020, 00:18 - Richie: It doesn't have street level

I faced this issue months ago, I couldn’t get a TopoJSON file for street level map
19/07/2020, 00:19 - Richie: This has it but this is the matter i am referring to..
19/07/2020, 00:19 - Yusfat: 🚶
19/07/2020, 00:19 - +234 814 324 3024: I doubt you can find a street level data publicly available

19/07/2020, 00:20 - +234 814 324 3024: Lol. You can do some querying. Try overpass api

19/07/2020, 00:23 - +234 814 324 3024: You can map it yourself on OSM using JOSM then🤧
19/07/2020, 00:23 - Richie: I like your emoji 😂
19/07/2020, 00:24 - Richie: You know how difficult that is even 2weeks we never finish to draw lines in Ikeja😂
19/07/2020, 00:26 - +234 814 324 3024: What kind of data do you need on a street level? Roads or boundaries? Or buildings?
19/07/2020, 00:26 - Richie: Well i managed to pull over the 600 route using QGIS and Google
19/07/2020, 00:26 - Richie: Route
19/07/2020, 00:27 - Richie: Road
19/07/2020, 00:28 - +234 814 324 3024: You can get roads from OSM using QGIS ,ArcGIS and JOSM
19/07/2020, 00:28 - +234 814 324 3024: It's easier on QGIS using the OSM plug-in
19/07/2020, 00:29 - Richie: Well i have roads but the reasons i said routes is because some roads are labeled as street and vise verse... Also the road shapefile don't come with Name tag
19/07/2020, 00:29 - +234 814 324 3024: You can load Lagos in JOSM an do some minor adjustments and edits the export the data for use in GeoJSON format.
19/07/2020, 00:29 - +234 814 324 3024: JOSM to the rescue
19/07/2020, 00:29 - Richie: Do you have experience using this?
19/07/2020, 00:30 - +234 814 324 3024: Yes, I do. I use it on a daily.
19/07/2020, 00:31 - Richie: Ok.. Lets port to private mode..

I’m having problem trying to push my code from my local pc to remote GitHub. This is the code I used. 
(git remote add name url
git push -name master)

But its not working
20/07/2020, 23:19 - +234 806 691 2700: The remote github is your personal repo right ?
20/07/2020, 23:19 - +234 816 827 7550: Yes
20/07/2020, 23:19 - +234 802 825 9007: Have you committed the code?
20/07/2020, 23:20 - +234 816 827 7550: Yes done that
20/07/2020, 23:20 - +234 816 827 7550: I created the repo from git bash using (git init foldername)
20/07/2020, 23:22 - +234 802 825 9007: Check if the remote was added using git remote --v
20/07/2020, 23:23 - +234 816 827 7550: Yes it’s there
20/07/2020, 23:23 - +234 802 825 9007: What error is it giving when you're pushing the code?
20/07/2020, 23:25 - +234 802 825 9007: But you've successfully pushed to origin master
20/07/2020, 23:26 - +234 802 825 9007: You can only push to origin master
20/07/2020, 23:26 - +234 802 825 9007: There's no branch like damo master
20/07/2020, 23:26 - +234 816 827 7550: Ehn ehn
How come I’m not seeing it under the list of my  GitHub repo
20/07/2020, 23:26 - +234 816 827 7550: Oh
20/07/2020, 23:26 - +234 816 827 7550: Okay
20/07/2020, 23:27 - +234 802 825 9007: Well I don't know for sure

20/07/2020, 23:28 - +234 816 827 7550: I mean I’ve tried that too
20/07/2020, 23:30 - +234 806 691 2700: Well for me , this work  git add ., git commit -m " "  and  git push
20/07/2020, 23:31 - +234 816 827 7550: I have done all that , it’s only the push that is giving me issues
20/07/2020, 23:31 - +234 816 398 2854: *git push origin master*
20/07/2020, 23:32 - +234 816 398 2854: that would push to your remote master branch
20/07/2020, 23:32 - +234 806 691 2700: Provided you are on your master branch in your local pc
20/07/2020, 23:33 - +234 816 398 2854: it clearly showed that he was on the master branch
20/07/2020, 23:33 - +234 816 398 2854: according to this image
20/07/2020, 23:33 - +234 806 691 2700: Okay

Anyone knows how I can install a package I've already downloaded  through url to anaconda...I used wget to download Pytorch cos of bad network in my area and now I need to install it locally to my anaconda

22/07/2020, 10:17 - +234 803 420 2314: I bet they don't understand a quarter of what they included. They copied those from different sites and pasted it in their description requirements to feel fly. 

When they employ an individual, it is basic excel and powerpoint they will require you to use due to their lack of understanding of the concepts they included.

Like what percentage can you be rest assured that the two strings mean the same/almost the same things.
24/07/2020, 04:42 - Obinna Iheanachor: I believe you are working on a Word2Vec model using Word embedding right?
I don't know if there's any such metric. Try checking online.

From my little experience with Word2Vec, since the similarity of words depends on the context of the vocabulary you are training with, the similarity of words is relative.

You pass your cosine similarity function while training the model, after several epochs you should start to see similar Word associations depending on the vocabulary.

24/07/2020, 12:21 - Olayinka: #PaperReview 

It's been a while. I had to take a short break to balance some things. It's good to be back. 

This week I read the paper titled: “Measuring patient-perceived quality of care in US hospitals using Twitter” by Jared Hawkins, et al. {2015).

It was a lovely read. One thing I took away from the paper is that hospitals need to start looking at Twitter data as a useful measure for supplementing traditional approaches of assessing and improving quality of care - from the patients perspective.

25/07/2020, 21:53 - +234 811 624 5920: BASICALLY, there are seven reasons why degree holders are poor.!!!

*1. THEY DON’T THINK BEYOND THEIR CERTIFICATES*

Albert Einstein said, “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.” Have you ever heard  creativity term “Think outside the box”? One of the major reasons why most graduates are poor is simply because they can’t see and think beyond their certificates. 
I have seen engineering students work as bankers. I have seen medical doctors with great skills in web and graphic designs. I have seen lawyers that are very dexterous with finances. The list is endless!

The basic truth of life is that the skills that are needed to be much sought after and become more successful in life are not really found within the walls of the classrooms. Your certificate is just a proof that you are teachable, it does not suggest what you are totally capable of doing. You are full of possibilities when you think beyond your degrees and certificates.

*2. THEY PRIORITIZE THEIR CERTIFICATES MORE THAN THEIR GIFTS AND TALENTS*

I have often advised some of my colleagues, never to leave their gifts dormant while pursuing and hunting for jobs with their certificates. There must be a complementary balance in the pursuit of your passion and in the search for jobs.

Everybody is gifted for something, but the winning edge comes from our ability to work on our gifts and bless the world with it. The very best way to develop yourself is in the direction of your natural talents and interest. In order to live a fulfilled and impactful life, we need to work harder on our gift than our job. We need to discover our gift, develop it, and sell it. Don’t bury your TALENT with your certificates.

*3. THEIR CERTIFICATES PREPARE THEM FOR A WORLD THAT NO LONGER EXIST*

It has been found that most of the skills taught in schools are becoming obsolete in the present world. The world has changed a lot, and so are people’s need! It is imperative to know that the present form of university education does not prepare students for the future.

Graduates are becoming endangered species in the face of a changing world. Our archaic methods and approaches of learning are preparing graduates for a world that no longer exist, as we are churning out degree holders every year with certificates that have face value but no intrinsic worth. Most learning institutions are filled up with lecturers and pseudo-educators with lecture notes, methods and approaches that have lost relevance in a changing world.

*4. THEY KNOW LESS ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT MORE ABOUT THINGS*

Certificates and degrees don’t reveal people to themselves; they at most measure our IQ (Intelligent Quotient). I have often tell people that there is no Recovery without Discovery. A poor man is simply someone that has not discovered himself.

The more you discover yourself, the more you realize the treasures that are hidden deep within you. We carry inside ourselves latent treasures that can only be unveiled through self-discovery.

*5. CERTIFICATES AND DEGREES CAN KILL INITIATIVES*

Degrees and certificates can close up your minds to ideas while initiatives open it up. If you are not careful, your degrees and certificates can close up your mind. The purpose of education is to keep your mind perpetually opened towards limitless possibilities!

Fred Smith saw an opportunity for overnight delivery of anything anywhere in the USA, and ultra- fast delivery anywhere in the world, FedEx was born. It will be interesting to know that Fred Smith got a grade “C” in a Yale economics class for an idea that the professor belittled as unworkable. 
Fred Smith’s company became the first American business to make over ten billion dollars in annual profit. Beginning with just 186 packages delivered the first night, FedEx now delivers in over two hundred countries using over 6,030 aircraft, 46,000 vehicles and 141,000 employees.

*6. DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES POSITION YOU TO LOOK FOR JOBS AND NOT FOR OPPORTUNITIES*

Our certificates and degrees prepare graduates to look for jobs and not open our eyes to life-changing opportunities. You are not poor because you don’t have a job; you are poor because you are not seeing and seizing opportunities.

Being POOR is simply Passing Over Opportunities Repeatedly! What keeps people ahead in life is not their education or degrees, it is simply the opportunity that they seized. Jobs may be scarce but not opportunities.

As long as there is a problem to be solved, there will always be opportunities. It is a waste of our education, exposure, and experiences if after we graduate from school, all we think about is searching for a job. An enlightened and educated mind should be able to see and seize opportunities.

*7. CERTIFICATES AND DEGREES PREPARE PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR SECURITY AND NOT TO TAKE RISKS*

We must be willing to make mistakes and take breakthrough risks. Taking risks and learning from mistakes help us in knowing what works and what does not! When Thomas Edison was being questioned by a mischievous journalist on how he felt for having failed for 999 times before getting the idea of the light bulb, his response stunned the whole world when he confidently said, “I have not failed 999 times, I have only learned 999 ways of how not to make a light bulb”.

Many graduates and degree holders are becoming progressively poor because the skills required in the modern world to get rich are not taught in schools and institutions.

By 2025, we’ll lose over five million jobs to automation. This means that future jobs will look vastly different by the time many people graduate from the university.

*Future jobs will involve KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION/CREATION* and innovation, and people that are only equipped with skills found in the classroom will definitely be a misfit in an ever-changing world. Skills like critical thinking, creativity, people’s skill, STEM skills (e.g Coding), complex problem-solving skills etc. are central to living a more comprehensive and productive life.

*8 THEREFORE,* in conclusion, My humble and candid advice to graduates and students in institutions is to think wide, deep and outside the box. Take volunteer jobs, and don’t be afraid to navigate fields that are different from your field of learning. Your future career will require you to pull information from many different fields to come up with creative solutions to future problems. 
Start by reading as much as you can about anything and everything that interests you. Once you get to college, consider double majoring or minoring in completely different fields. Trust me, it’ll pay off in the long run.

Don’t limit yourself to the classroom. Do something practical. Take a leadership position. Start a business and fail; that’s a better entrepreneurship. Contest an election and lose. It will teach you something political science will not teach you. Attend a seminar. Read books outside the scope of your course.

Think less of becoming an excellent student, but think more of becoming an excellent person. Don’t make the classroom your world, but make the world your classroom. Step forward and try something extra.

Invest in something you believe! Real financial security and freedom is not in your job, but in your passion, gifts, talents, and your ability to see and seize opportunities.

28/07/2020, 12:40 - +234 903 881 9790: Well done @2348110895622
28/07/2020, 12:45 - +234 903 881 9790: But it seems the data you used was from NUC. However, while working on a project name Graduate Torch and it became a necessity for me drill down analysis of University in Nigeria. But in my research, my data sources dated as far back 2018 stated that we have 174 University now, federal, state ans private inclusive.
I will appreciate if you can can share the source with me. I really need to be sure of the date I'm presenting.

Thanks man.
28/07/2020, 13:30 - Tosin Openiyi: Total accreditated Universities in Nigeria = 170.

I got the data directly from NUC website. 😁
28/07/2020, 13:32 - Mayokun: Please can you shift OAU to number 1.

Thank you Sir. 🏃🏻‍♀️ 🏃🏻‍♀️

28/07/2020, 15:20 - Muhammed: See my senior alumni here sel 🙄
28/07/2020, 15:27 - Muhammed: But on a serious note, we're in a mess in this country, NUC is the apex body managing the affairs of universities in Nigeria, hence they should have accurate data, but the issue is that even NBS is just another clown of an agency.

Check through the *Annual Abstract of Statistics* and see discrepancies between the figures quoted in two different publications coming from the same source.
28/07/2020, 15:29 - Muhammed: I made a request for 30 years historical stock data from NSE, and they're telling me to come and pay almost 400k 🤦‍♂️, when I am not even sure if the data won't be conjured from somewhere
28/07/2020, 15:41 - +234 706 297 4329: Pls anyone with a job aptitude test questions n answers pdf..it would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance
28/07/2020, 15:43 - Muhammed: Why not be specific, or you need just any aptitude test?
28/07/2020, 15:49 - +234 706 297 4329: I need for IPNX

28/07/2020, 17:11 - Olayinka: This is what researchers suffer
28/07/2020, 17:13 - Olayinka: I remember I wanted to work on "Using 5 state Markov model to predict the natural progression of diabetic nephropathy" for my MSc thesis. As at that time no work have been done for diabetic nephropathy... Guess waht?
28/07/2020, 17:14 - Olayinka: I couldn't get the data... I suffered ehn.. When I saw that I was delaying myself running to Luth and Unilag... I changed topic sharply to statistical comparison of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for Hospital readmission rates
28/07/2020, 17:16 - Olayinka: In fact, my mentor had to send me the data for US hospitals... Inaccessibility to Data just kills off many research ideas...

They will still tackle you that why did you use foreign data 👀
28/07/2020, 17:17 - +234 808 882 4940: This one that geosciences students would one to make research in Nigeria that students schooling in Nigeria won't find it easy getting data but their counterparts studying abroad easily get those data (all d way from outside Nigeria) from d likes of Chevron and the likes. It's really annoying.

Last year one giant oil firm released over a terabyte over seismic data for free and NSE is here asking my oga to pay such amount of money? 

They are not okay!😳😢
28/07/2020, 17:18 - +234 808 882 4940: would want* to
28/07/2020, 17:21 - Olayinka: Not only ŃSE.. Even Nimet... A colleague wanted to get temperature data from them... They told him to pay a lot self
28/07/2020, 17:21 - +234 808 882 4940: Did u ask them if they already predicted from their analysis wether u would pay or decline?
28/07/2020, 17:21 - +234 808 882 4940: We need to do something about this country
28/07/2020, 17:33 - Muhammed: There was a follow up mail sometimes last week, stating that they're yet to receive my payment and just yesterday a woman called me from NSE to ask if I'm still going to pay, I just told her that I got an alternative already
28/07/2020, 17:36 - Muhammed: I had a source of getting the data, but it's not up to 10 years, and I'm interested in working with a data set of minimum of 10 years.
28/07/2020, 17:39 - Muhammed: While working on my B. Tech final project, I had to use a connection at WHO to extract data on *Neonatal Mortality in Nigeria* though it's available openly, but there are certain confidential information that are not thrown open
28/07/2020, 17:40 - Tosin Openiyi: NBS get issues jawe.... Their data connection is inconsistent for whatever reasons 🌚
28/07/2020, 17:41 - Muhammed: I was a Field Enumerator and Data Administration Officer at NBS, Ilorin for 6 months in 2017. That place is a hell of a place

31/07/2020, 14:28 - +234 816 827 7550: Good afternoon house. Someone please help me.

I’m working on a train dataset which has a categorical column (the column has 5 unique categories). 
I wanted to predict on my test dataset now and found out that it (the test dataset) contains only 4 of the unique categories 😭. 

I’m using logistics regression . So calling predict_proba() on it is giving me errors. 

Please what can I do?
31/07/2020, 14:34 - +234 816 827 7550: Note: I did not split the data myself. The test dataset was direct from kaggle
31/07/2020, 14:44 - +234 810 878 6913: Have you converted the categorical data to dummy variables?
31/07/2020, 14:46 - +234 810 878 6913: We're still saying the same thing.
31/07/2020, 14:46 - +234 810 878 6913: Convert the categorical data to dummy
31/07/2020, 14:47 - +234 810 878 6913: And use to test
31/07/2020, 14:47 - +234 810 878 6913: Hope you have done your feature Engineering and all
31/07/2020, 15:02 - +234 816 827 7550: Yes
That was what made me realize the error sef. 
I did one hot encoding, and U know how one hot encoding will create a column each, for each unique item in one categorical column
31/07/2020, 15:02 - +234 816 827 7550: Yes
31/07/2020, 15:02 - +234 816 827 7550: Done that
That was what brought the error into picture
31/07/2020, 15:11 - +234 810 878 6913: Yea. You should had used get_dummy instead

31/07/2020, 18:48 - +234 808 882 4940: Good day all, considering the relationship between BIAS and VARIANCE which we cannot escape, would I be right to say that increase in Bias (bad) which leads to decrease in variance (good) OR

decrease in BIAS (good) which lead to increase in VARIANCE (bad) resulting from model complexity, is the reason why our model predictions cannot be 100% accurate??


Summary: is bias vs variance relationship the only reason why Machine Learning model predictions cannot be 100% accurate? or are there any other different reasons why we can't make 100% predictions?

Thank you! :+1:

08/08/2020, 15:10 - +234 816 827 7550: I think TP+ FN
08/08/2020, 16:13 - +234 808 882 4940: Thank you

But, if it is TP + FN , that means the formula above is RECALL.

Does it mean *RECALL = SENSITIVITY?*
08/08/2020, 16:15 - +234 705 579 9202: Another name for recall is *sensitivity* or *True positive rate*

Thanks bro

Could that be PRECISION???🤔🤔🤔

08/08/2020, 16:22 - +234 816 827 7550: Specifity is also True Negative Rate
08/08/2020, 16:23 - +234 808 882 4940: If so, then I think it may likely be precision. I will research it soon
08/08/2020, 16:32 - +234 816 827 7550: It’s not o
Precision is TP/#predicted positive 
I.e TP/(TP+FP)
08/08/2020, 16:33 - +234 816 827 7550: Specifity is TN/(FP+TN)

Reaching out of a colleague could be hell at times, though someone like me would prefer a remote job to me reporting to the office daily. Until my exit from my former company, I go to the office only when it's absolutely necessary for me to go, or if I need to do some things around the Island.

Though not all companies support that, but the company is really flexible, all that matters is that you deliver your part of the bargain. Just a few guys do work from the office, the rest of us work remotely

Just being curious. Appears as if one cannot convert the knowledge to a full time degree?🤔

18/08/2020, 00:57 - Obinna Iheanachor: Check this out
https://github.com/sitiom/PluralCrypt

You'll need to have downloaded the video with the offline software.

You can then use the pluralcrypt app to decrypt the videos so that even if your subscription expires, the videos are saved permanently on your laptop.
18/08/2020, 00:59 - Obinna Iheanachor: Alternatively you can try downloading one video at a time using Google Chrome developer tools.

I found this method tasking and it doesn't work for all courses.

19/08/2020, 12:47 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Nice post guy 👌

I've dropped my comment

I don't think Data Scientist will be the Future CEOs though
19/08/2020, 12:52 - Obinna Iheanachor: The title is misleading (intentional). The proper title should be: Are Data Scientists (or people with Data Analytics backgrounds) better positioned to be CEOs.

If you carefully read through the article, I positioned that CEOs have unique traits that can be learned over time.
If a Data Scientist (or someone having a Data Analytics background) with leadership aspirations learn these traits, he/she would make a great CEO.
19/08/2020, 12:53 - Obinna Iheanachor: It's great we are having these conversations, differing points of view are entirely welcome.

19/08/2020, 13:35 - +234 706 670 9874: Good piece. Basically, a data scientist should acquire business skill along with its analytic skill.
19/08/2020, 13:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This message was deleted
19/08/2020, 13:43 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Just to add, I think you are looking at it from a product development perspective which will be valid, but reality is many CEOs or let me say not all CEOs manage a product or develop one, however since Analytics is disrupting the modus operandi of Product management to factor more agile and sustainable approach to a product lifecycle, so it will be much valid to say they are the future product managers 


Once again, nice piece fam!

19/08/2020, 13:51 - +234 810 287 5586: Awesome piece

I like that it is bringing up discussions


I however think I support @2348108522573 here too

I get your point, but most times you don’t really need to be very smart or all have the resources/data to be a CEO.

CEOs just need to know how to put smart and resourceful people together and put them to good use. They need to find a good data scientist and leverage on their brains and skills.

It’s like surgeons and Medical directors. Surgeons are important engines for hospitals but they can’t be great surgeons and lead hospital affairs at the same time. Someone has to do the business  of the hospital. 

So yes, leadership traits if learnt by analysts place them in good positions to be CEOs but if you have to excel at any you have to pick one to primarily dwell on.

Mostly because CEOs many times have to act contrary to how data scientists will act, CEOs are more likely to take on risk for the business however data scientists are more logical and analytical... and less likely to take risk.

My 2 cents sha

Oh my that was a lot.
19/08/2020, 13:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Spot on!

It's driven toward people's skills than Analytics skill actually
19/08/2020, 14:01 - Obinna Iheanachor: If you actually read the piece, I clearly stated that Data Scientists who learn these people skills will make better CEOs than the traditional CEO.

The biggest challenge to the full-scale adoption of Data Analytics in most organizations is company culture.
A CEO with a data-analytics background is better positioned to effect these changes.
19/08/2020, 14:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I get your point actually but the truth is you don't need to have an analytical skills to be a great CEO

Just as Favor has spotted a good people's skill will make you have the right folks on board to give you great ideas to execute and you lead, so will having analytical background be a plus? Well, I'm not sure, that's probably why you will have someone playing the analytical role & data strategy to share ideas with you as the CEO


I get your point about having a data culture which may be easy to execute if the CEO have an analytical background, however  it's actually not the case.

After COB I will share a McKinsey article that gave some insights.

Once again well done fam

Generally and particularly In computing, it is believed that the state of a statement or proposition could either be true or false - 0 or 1 - and it can't never stay in between.

If the above is so true, why do we bother calculating the probability of an outcome occuring in ML when we've been told that an outcome could either be True of False. If it turns out True, what is the point of calculating the degree of likelihood.

20/08/2020, 16:53 - +234 817 965 1769: I made this lovely analysis on Female Genital Mutilation in Africa. Somalia has the highest number of cases while Nigeria occupied the third position. FGM Type 1 is the most common one. Also, 4 countries out of 17 countries in Africa usually involve in re-infibulation of Type 3. Check my post on medium or LinkedIn to read more. Don't forget to like, drop a comment and share.

Notes:
FGM is different from circumcision. FGM is condemned by all religions while Islam makes circumcision optional (from what I read and understand) for females. However, many people deliberately or not do mix them together.
FGM is against human's right as positioned by UNICEF because it comes with a lot of risk for females.

22/08/2020, 23:16 - +234 812 216 8133: I guess you can't always have it all. If I got a job after service there, I wouldn't have any business returning to Lagos walahi.
22/08/2020, 23:16 - Muhammed: You're currently serving here in kwara?

23/08/2020, 01:18 - Olayinka: Very strong! Who calms down to write these stuffs
23/08/2020, 08:07 - Muhammed: One 21st century colonial master ní jàre 😂 🤣
23/08/2020, 08:15 - +234 817 965 1769: When I saw a lot of chat, I was thinking people were gossiping about WEJAPA matter
23/08/2020, 08:16 - +234 703 365 7422: 😂😂😂😂😂
23/08/2020, 08:17 - +234 817 965 1769: Because somebody said any tech community that is not gisting aand gossiping about WEJAPA and Favour Ori is not UP and DOING
23/08/2020, 08:20 - Muhammed: Wejapa is one of the #techpuppis we've got in Africa
23/08/2020, 08:20 - Muhammed: Maserati 2020 😂😂😂
23/08/2020, 08:23 - David Adeyemo: 😃
23/08/2020, 08:23 - David Adeyemo: Best African tech talent right....... 😊😊😊

#Just Sarcasm
23/08/2020, 08:25 - Muhammed: You better go and join his team, so you can get a Maserati 2020 😉😁
23/08/2020, 08:29 - +234 703 344 8466: Going through that thread made me angry and sad. There are many others like him still out there. Really changed my perspective on some things.
23/08/2020, 08:32 - David Adeyemo: Very painful! 

The extortion + insidious attitude is too extreme....
23/08/2020, 08:41 - Muhammed: Time guys learn when and how to bow out of a toxic work environment. Being jobless is not easy, but falling a victim to these 21st century colonial masters, is worse
23/08/2020, 08:44 - Muhammed: Don't have outrageous expectations, but know your base worth, don't be carried away by the remuneration contained in an NDA, instead, digest the T&C, get someone else to interpret it for you
23/08/2020, 08:45 - Muhammed: Search up employees of the company from LinkedIn, reach out to them politely, ask them about their experience in the company so far
23/08/2020, 08:45 - David Adeyemo: Succinct!
23/08/2020, 08:47 - Muhammed: Most of those guys are leveraging on the fact that there are no jobs out there, hence, they made it seem like they are doing you a favor by hiring you
23/08/2020, 08:48 - Muhammed: But in reality, they want to use you for their own benefits and at your own peril/detriment
23/08/2020, 08:55 - Muhammed: Some will even offer you expensive laptops and other logistics, but please imbibe the culture of evaluating your growth at defined intervals (say quarterly), if you are not moving close to the plan you drew at the beginning of the year (work year), try investigate what could be the blocking storm. If it's a problem from your end, fix it, else please try to seek alternative work place if after a year, you haven't achieved at least 30% of your expectations (provided the problem is not from your end).
23/08/2020, 09:29 - +234 703 344 8466: So much technical talent abound in the Nigerian tech space and they know this. But due to lack of opportunities, many are feeding hand to mouth and would jump at anything internship just to get a potential shot of making it. Turns out all na wash... So disillusioned!!!
23/08/2020, 09:31 - +234 703 344 8466: Bros it isn't easy.. Being jobless in such harsh climes... You would endure what ever crap your employer dishes out.. You get openly threatened to leave the job if you don't like it.. That many others are out there waiting for your spot willing to accept quarter your pay
23/08/2020, 09:36 - Muhammed: I quite understand and agree with you about this, however, please don't willingly submit yourself to modern slavery, rather, you can collaborate with like minded people and get started with something (NB: this is not as easy as it seems), but invariably, things will fall place
23/08/2020, 09:36 - Muhammed: Let's pray and hope for the best from god
God
23/08/2020, 09:41 - +234 703 344 8466: Of course.. Its just a general perspective of what is going on... It isn't going to be easy too.. Eventually when the breakthrough comes.. I hope we have the morals to not be what we criticised
23/08/2020, 09:48 - Muhammed: Deep 🤔
23/08/2020, 09:49 - Muhammed: Let's hope so, cos I'm a disciple of Karma (not everyone subscribes to that though), but invariably, we'd all be served in our dishes at different points in life
23/08/2020, 12:46 - +234 812 216 8133: Can you drop a link to that thread?

25/08/2020, 21:34 - +234 813 482 8979: Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

Ans)I’m a student from India and want to learn Blockchain Technology. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship,it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.I want to take this course as I want to learn.This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

Ans)My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Blockchain Technology and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge.This course will help me in defining Blockchain Technology,understanding how Blockchain could potentially impact our business and industry,to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Blockchain technology,explain Blockchain Technology to clients, friends,joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak.Identifying which aspects of Blockchain Technology seem most important and relevant to us,Walking away with a strong foundation in where blockchain is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Blockchain course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past.

Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.

Ans)Simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.

10/09/2020, 20:52 - Muhammed: Alright, I got a referral to a bank and I'll be having a virtual interview with the head of Data Analytics of the bank, just want to get an idea of likely things to be expecting. I haven't worked directly in the financial sector before, so any tip would be helpful.
10/09/2020, 20:53 - Muhammed: I shouldn't rely solely on my general knowledge of DS, there might be some *technical areas* to look up before the interview
10/09/2020, 20:54 - +234 816 381 5935: What bank to be precise?
10/09/2020, 20:54 - +234 816 381 5935: Might have some tips to share.
10/09/2020, 20:55 - Muhammed: Fcmb
10/09/2020, 20:58 - +234 816 381 5935: Okay. Based on my experience interviewing with banks so far, I think most the majority will ask you to walk them through the projects you've worked on. Impacts of the projects. How you were able to pull through challenges. How you work well in a team. After the interview, some might give you some data to play with. Just to get a sense of what you can do.
10/09/2020, 20:59 - Muhammed: Alright thanks bro ✌️, really appreciate these tips
10/09/2020, 20:59 - +234 816 381 5935: No wahala boss. You will be fine....

What FIs care about is how to minimize their risk
10/09/2020, 21:35 - Richie: So a need to rebuild the algorithm is needed
10/09/2020, 21:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: They probably may ask, so you want to tell them what they want to hear and how DS can assist
10/09/2020, 21:36 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yeah yeah man
10/09/2020, 21:37 - +234 708 531 6273: Also, cyber fraud is on the increase due to relaxed internal measures. There is a need to build sophisticated fraud detection models

11/09/2020, 11:50 - David Adeyemo: Dear All. Trust we're all keeping well

Since we have consultants here.....  Please anyone familiar with SAP analytics cloud. 

If yes, please would you advise SAP over PowerBI?
11/09/2020, 11:50 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It depend on the use case actually
11/09/2020, 11:51 - David Adeyemo: For visualization and dashboard reporting.....
11/09/2020, 11:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: PowerBI is a BI tool while SAP often serve purpose of Data storage/warehousing and also have some built-in Analytics capability
11/09/2020, 11:52 - David Adeyemo: My org. changed the ERP so they purchased SAP Analytics Cloud(SAC) which is the BI aspect of SAP.....
11/09/2020, 11:52 - David Adeyemo: Yes boss.......
11/09/2020, 11:54 - David Adeyemo: Please I am asking because it doesn't look too interactive from hindsight...... However,  I don't want to be bias towards the application.... 

So I am seeking for Pro's advise...
11/09/2020, 12:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Lol
11/09/2020, 12:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Do you guys have a self service BI structure or a team saddled with doing the Analytics while others using SAP for their data storage ?
11/09/2020, 12:03 - David Adeyemo: Yes please......
11/09/2020, 12:03 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The later?
11/09/2020, 12:04 - David Adeyemo: Yes......  Before now, in terms of the storage they were using an app related to SQL server....
11/09/2020, 12:04 - David Adeyemo: But the org decided to go cloud which is why they are switching from the App to SAP.....
11/09/2020, 12:05 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Okay, great.
11/09/2020, 12:05 - David Adeyemo: I hope I am able to clarify this......
11/09/2020, 12:06 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I don't think opt-in for PowerBI licensing is the best way to go from cost perspectives given that they have subscribed for a BI provider unless if the business use case is justified where they want to go full blown self service
11/09/2020, 12:07 - David Adeyemo: Although,  before now the org. had a powerBI licensing.... 😋😋😋
11/09/2020, 12:08 - Tosin Openiyi: I think you should just prepare your mind and get ready to learn SAP Bro. 😀

Learning crystal report back in the days was fun. It's an SAP product for reporting and more robust compare to report builder (Microsoft).

Microsoft solutions have an edge over other products, maybe in this part of the world but that does not mean they are the best.
11/09/2020, 12:09 - David Adeyemo: Toorrrr 

Dem chief have spoken🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
11/09/2020, 12:09 - Tosin Openiyi: Your org. ain't a fan of Microsoft products.... Eayah

11/09/2020, 19:13 - Muhammed: Good evening guys, thanks for the tips and wishes yesterday. I eventually had the meeting, it went well, but on technical grounds, I won't be picking up the offer, however, I do mention that I will be referring people who might be interested in the opening to the man.

Highlighted here are the main reasons I won't be able to pick up the offer
1. It's not an in-house recruitment at FCMB, rather, the man (whom I was referred to) is a group manager at FCMB, and is hiring someone who shall be managing the analytics of his two private businesses, while also absolving a great part of his duties at FCMB as it relates to Data Analytics.

2. The job is strictly for Lag based people and I'm currently out of Lagos.

Hence, if you feel you can take up the offer, please slide into my DM for full appraisal. (man seems to be ready to pay high though)
11/09/2020, 19:14 - Muhammed: Told him I'd be referring about 3 people and he can pick his choice thereaft

12/09/2020, 21:01 - +234 816 342 0137: Hello, does anyone know I can go about this?

I downloaded cifar10 dataset in batches from their website and I had to separate both the images and the labels. 

Image is 3 dimensional while labels is 1.

I've created a CNN network and I need to train it with the dataset. 

I tried to put the images and labels in a tuple and pass them to a torch.utils.data.DataLoader but it keeps throwing error that they are not of the same dimensions...how do I resolve this please?

19/09/2020, 08:11 - +234 803 420 2314: What annoys me is that all these people just copy descriptions from the internet and paste as theirs without actually knowing what its is just to feel fly/among
19/09/2020, 08:17 - +234 803 420 2314: Imagine;
*User interface design*
*User experience design*
*Illustrator*
*Adobe XD*
*HTML/CSS*

Now, user experience design and html/css means more or less same thing, user interface design/illustrator/adobe xd are more or less same cuz they are prototypes/mockups.....
19/09/2020, 08:19 - +234 817 965 1769: They can even say user experience is for web designer and HTML and CSS is for front end developer.

So when web designer use adobe to design, front end will use HTML and CSS to implement it
19/09/2020, 08:20 - +234 817 965 1769: The stuff is: they need full stack developer who also has background in UIUX is intern?

Who did this to u
19/09/2020, 08:21 - +234 817 965 1769: to us? Enslaving people and presenting it because of the situation of the country.
19/09/2020, 08:21 - +234 803 420 2314: In other words, they need someone that knows;

Programming (JavaScript, Python)
SQL
Graphic design
Django/Flask

29/09/2020, 22:05 - +234 817 965 1769: *WRITING RECOMMENDATION LETTERS*

by Prof. Moses Ochonu

Let's discuss how Nigerians unintentionally--or as a compatriot told me recently, intentionally--sabotage other Nigerians' chances of upward socioeconomic and educational mobility.

A talented Nigerian student/graduate is applying to a graduate program in Euro-America and asks her current or former lecturers to write her the required recommendation letters. Some of the lecturers don't even bother to write the letter. The applicant has to chase them down and plead. Sometimes they have to travel from one part of the country to the other  to plead in person as phone calls, texts, and emails don't work with the lecturers. 

It's as though the lecturers don't want to support the applicant's foreign educational aspirations. It's part of their job, but lecturers act as if they're doing their current and former students a favor by writing these letters. Many applicants have missed critical application deadlines because of this attitude. 

The ones who agree to write the letter take the most cavalier attitude to it. They write unusably perfunctory nonsense such as "Ms so and so was a student in our department; she was a well behaved student; she worked hard and performed well in her classes; she has a good character and is very respectful; her academic record is okay."

Far from helping the applicant's chances, this type of letter actually damages and puts her at a disadvantage in relation to her fellow applicants. I should know, since I've served on both graduate admissions and fellowship and grant committees many times.

Where to begin? First of all such a letter says nothing, absolutely nothing, about the applicant's intellectual abilities, unique academic skills, or the specificities of their academic record. It  is too general to be useful. It does not offer any insight into the lecturer's academic/intellectual relationship with the applicant, so why should we take the letter writer seriously as someone who can vouch for the applicant?

There is no mention of classes the applicant took with the lecturer, how they did in such classes, how they stood out, what they did to impress the lecturer, why the lecturer believes the applicant would thrive and blossom in the graduate program, etc.

There is no praise, no enthusiasm--only bland, lukewarm, generic comments. It's better not to write a recommendation than to write one that does not endorse the applicant or highlight her intellectual promise and quality. 

Then there is the issue of brevity. Some of these letters that I've seen are one paragraph or at most two--too sketchy to offer any substantive glimpse into the applicant's abilities or give one a sense of the applicant's unique talents and intellectual drive.

Finally, there is the annoyingly meaningless deployment of Nigerian idiosyncrasies and cliches. When a Nigerian lecturer writes "hardworking," the North American evaluators of the applicant's materials read it as "mediocre." When the evaluators see a word such as "solid," they don't think it indicates excellence, as it might in Nigeria. In popular and even professional Nigerian usage, "okay" means good. Not so in the North American educational parlance. It does not mean good. Rather, it denotes bad or mediocre. Saying someone is "okay" indicates reservation, that the letter writer is holding back outright praise because the applicant does not deserve it.

And nobody wants to know or cares about the applicant's personal character, so commenting on how well behaved or respectful she is is an unhelpful digression at best and at worst a damaging indication that you have nothing substantive or glowing to say about her academic abilities and intellectual talent. What has the applicant being "kind" got to do with her ability to undertake graduate work, cope with its rigors, and do well?

I don't know whether it is laziness on the part of the lecturers or a lack of awareness about Western higher educational conventions. I suppose it's a mix of the two.

Whatever it is, these lecturers are destroying the chances and prospects of talented Nigerian applicants, who lose out of opportunities because their former or current teachers write non-recommendation recommendation letters on their behalf. 

I've lived and worked in America long enough to know that, in making admission and other decisions, no evaluator will ignore a sketchy, general, and lukewarm endorsement from a person who purportedly knows and has taught and mentored the applicant--the recommender. If the recommending lecturer doesn't sound so enthusiastic about the applicant, why should I? That's the general attitude.

Ignorance of what is expected in the letter is no excuse. I've even seen such a letter which was written by a Nigeria-based lecturer who studied in the US and is thus aware of how critical recommendation letters are and how they should be written. This lends credence to the theory that some of this could be intentional sabotage on the part of some recommending lecturers.

It is sometimes so sad and frustrating for folks like me to read recommendation letters from North American professors saying that such and such applicant is a reincarnation of Albert Einstein and Jacques Derrida in one flesh and then to read a meaningless three-sentence recommendation letter from a Nigerian lecturer about a Nigerian applicant you know is much more talented than the North American applicant whose abilities and talents are being advanced in highfalutin, exaggerated terms.

The interesting thing is that I read recommendation letters written by academics in other countries for other international applicants and they conform for the most part to the North American convention of high praise and substantive commentary on the applicant, her accomplishments, and her ongoing work. 

We're cheating ourselves and putting ourselves at a disadvantage in a globalized, hyper-competitive world.

06/10/2020, 08:26 - Jenny: Good morning... 

I’m trying to get duplicates transactions in 2 excel sheets using Vlookup. I keep getting #n/a when the transaction is actually there.. 

Guys how do I resolve
06/10/2020, 08:29 - Tosin Openiyi: Check your vlookup formula very well
06/10/2020, 08:30 - Jenny: I have
06/10/2020, 08:32 - Jenny: I had to cnvert the Column to number still nothing
06/10/2020, 08:32 - +234 816 631 6330: Trim your lookup value from both sheets
06/10/2020, 08:33 - Jenny: Okay... do i need to trim the table array aswell?
06/10/2020, 08:34 - +234 816 631 6330: No
06/10/2020, 08:34 - Tosin Openiyi: Alternative to vlookup is Merge Query in Power Query... Or Index Match
06/10/2020, 08:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Check the format

Try format the columns to be the same
06/10/2020, 08:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Boss ways 🥴
06/10/2020, 08:36 - Tosin Openiyi: Also ensure that your lookup value is on the right
06/10/2020, 08:36 - Tosin Openiyi: My Oga
06/10/2020, 08:38 - Jenny: Yes I noticed my lookup num values was left aligned so I converted to number, to make it right aligned
06/10/2020, 08:39 - Tosin Openiyi: Not the alignment.... It's the column position
06/10/2020, 08:40 - Jenny: I don’t understand pls
06/10/2020, 08:41 - Tosin Openiyi: Vlookup cannot look to the left
06/10/2020, 08:42 - +234 810 287 5586: This could be the reason

Index match is a better option
06/10/2020, 08:43 - +234 810 287 5586: Baba of Bosses
06/10/2020, 08:46 - Tosin Openiyi: Amen to your prayer 🙌🏿 😃
06/10/2020, 08:50 - +234 816 771 0243: What you are looking for has to be after your lookup value.

If you can do a screenshot we can help better
06/10/2020, 08:54 - Jenny: Ohhhh I’m returning the same column “Cust_id”. It’s my lookup value and the same position in my table array not after
06/10/2020, 08:55 - Muhammed: Mind sending a screenshot?
06/10/2020, 13:09 - +234 803 420 2314: Fix your column.
1. Insert a new column next to it say (C is where ur input is, insert a blank in D). On D2 (below headers) use Trim(C2) and fill down. Now copy the D-range and then ''' right click *C column* and *'paste values'*'''. You can now delete the D column created.

Note, use IFERROR before the Vlookup to ensure that you get a response if the value is unavailable or a blank, just like the assert in python. 

Hope this helps sha. Na d small wey i sabi.
06/10/2020, 13:10 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 📌📌
06/10/2020, 13:10 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's mostly the trick if you can export it to Powerquery to do the cleaning and merge
06/10/2020, 13:10 - +234 803 420 2314: Also note (u know this already), in the table array to be looked up, the lookup value should be the first column
06/10/2020, 13:11 - +234 803 420 2314: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
06/10/2020, 13:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *can't
06/10/2020, 13:14 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348107040047 if any of the above doesn't work, do well to share a screenshot like prince_analyst said
06/10/2020, 13:46 - +234 803 420 2314: You need to understand 'index and match' well enough to use it. But that may just be your final resort.
06/10/2020, 14:10 - Muhammed: Spot on
06/10/2020, 14:33 - Richie: So will help me take an interview on excel python and PowerBI.. 😊😊...

06/10/2020, 20:29 - +234 811 858 6001: Would u advise me to download the *PDF slides* or download the video?
06/10/2020, 21:52 - Muhammed: Depends on your choice really, the slides are the transcripts of the video, hence I'd prefer slides over videos
06/10/2020, 22:23 - +234 811 858 6001: generally - none of these.
06/10/2020, 22:23 - +234 811 858 6001: I am trying to safe time and data ...

Who knows a Machine learning/AI developer with focus on Computer Vision? 

please the person should reach out to my colleague on  samuelogbonna30@gmail.com
08/10/2020, 15:10 - +234 811 858 6001: Hello, I am confused... I got through data camp via Dr Mrs Sekinat's scholarship initiative...
08/10/2020, 15:10 - +234 811 858 6001: I have access to lots of courses based on a particular subscription
08/10/2020, 15:11 - +234 811 858 6001: Now, I got this too... and I am confused... Am I not subscribed to the same thing from different organizations?
08/10/2020, 15:12 - +234 811 858 6001: I mean... I don't know if anyone get me
08/10/2020, 15:13 - +234 811 858 6001: Seems it's same subscription package

09/10/2020, 06:22 - Tosin Openiyi: @2348118586001 kinda ensure you make the most of your DataCamp Scholarship. This is enjoyment galore for you 😃 BTW, I'm not connecting with your concern sha...
09/10/2020, 06:24 - +234 806 513 1448: I got the same scholarship too. You are supposed to chose any path or course and continue learning for the duration of the scholarship
09/10/2020, 06:28 - +234 806 513 1448: The only thing the scholarship gives you is access to any course there which you would have been paying monthly subscription fee previously
09/10/2020, 06:29 - +234 806 513 1448: There is no particular course or task that you should do, just learn as much as you can until the scholarship elapses next year then you would have to subscribe
09/10/2020, 06:48 - Tosin Openiyi: This is 💯 correct.
Do you know the duration of the scholarship?
09/10/2020, 06:49 - +234 806 513 1448: Mine started in September. Till March next year I think. 6 months
09/10/2020, 06:49 - Tosin Openiyi: Ingressive4good?
09/10/2020, 06:51 - +234 806 513 1448: I can’t remember the platform I applied on. But I don’t think it is ingressive. It’s was from Olabisi Onabanjo University that got back to me that I have been selected
09/10/2020, 06:52 - +234 806 513 1448: It’s Olabisi Onabanjo University that got back to me ***

09/10/2020, 16:33 - +234 806 513 1448: I don’t think so

11/10/2020, 11:02 - Muhammed: Well there are two ways to it, that the guy told him he's senseless doesn't generalize that all young Nigerians are mannerless. I have had first-hand experiences with those rouges called SARS, and I'd never want anyone to experience what I went through with those men.

He's entitled to his opinions as everyone else who has posted for or against the SARS menace
11/10/2020, 11:07 - +234 818 368 5814: He use to be someone I respected so much... Tech Devs persons can’t even go out with ful gadgets anymore. Well, he’s entitled to his opinions as he said.
11/10/2020, 12:06 - Muhammed: He said he'd pipe low, keep quiet so he doesn't receive a knock, how I wish this is Twitter, where people would take their time to school him. It'll do him no harms to keep quiet as he said.

He's guilty of what he's accusing people of, he also posted to gain attention (I might be wrong though ☹️), but his post seems so
11/10/2020, 12:11 - Muhammed: <Media omitted>

11/10/2020, 12:15 - +234 816 677 6236: Am telling you, this just made me sick!! It really was a joke to him
11/10/2020, 12:16 - +234 818 368 5814: That’s what I’m actually angry about.. Keeping quite is not bad but what’s the essence of trolling the people that want to speak out. I remembered my first encounter with this monsters called SARS before Alagomeji bus stop. We( me and some other learners) just left DSN class(Introduction to Machine Learning), you need to see the way and manner this guys drove us to a corner. As if that wasn’t enough, we were sorrounded like armed robber unto say we carry pc. All thanks to one of the guys that reached out to segalink. I still remember one of them said and I quote “ we will kill all of you here now and tag you yahoo boys. When he noticed we have 2 lady’s amongst us, he said again “Ha, you’re now teaching girls sef this yahoo thing. No wahala, we go kill all of you join”
11/10/2020, 12:17 - Richie: Senseless.. I don't pray him bad but soon what you sow I trust earth... Your reaping is coming.... I wish he even gave the opinion he said others could not...
11/10/2020, 12:17 - +234 818 368 5814: I’m damn serious... He doesn’t have
11/10/2020, 12:20 - Richie: Mumu... He doesn't have a side.. Which mumu people can this one help😒... Instead to keep quite your data plan was freaking him to post nonsense...
11/10/2020, 12:21 - +234 818 368 5814: He’s a politician and he just played the game the way they play it...
11/10/2020, 12:22 - Muhammed: Now you're getting the gist 😉😋
11/10/2020, 12:23 - Richie: He is still a big full.. Politician won't do this... Check the serious one..

11/10/2020, 12:56 - +234 811 858 6001: Who is senseless here biko?
11/10/2020, 12:56 - Richie: Use NLP to find out
11/10/2020, 12:57 - Richie: The article is what i am referring to.. and if the article is not making sense its obvious the Author too😊... Hope I am cleared
11/10/2020, 12:58 - +234 806 840 6384: Imagine what he said *"we will kill all of you here now and tag you yahoo boys"* 

Even if the people are yahoo boys,  so the instructions given to them is "kill at sight"? What a country

11/10/2020, 13:41 - Muhammed: SARS is said to be officially dissolved, it's not time yet to rejoice, rather, it's time to reform the entire #nigerianpoliceforce, cos those men will be integrated into other units of the #nigerianpoliceforce, hence the brutality continues in a new form, which might be deadlier than what we had earlier in the hands of SARS.

Please what is the current exam code for Microsoft data analytics exam?
11/10/2020, 15:55 - +234 806 351 4863: I want to write but I need the code so I wouldn't go make mistake and be reading the retired exam code

12/10/2020, 10:51 - +234 803 420 2314: Replace and strip.

But please what method did you use so i would know if there is an optimal way to do it.
12/10/2020, 11:01 - +234 703 344 8466: This didn't work.

I used df. columns.rename
But copied the encoding in the column names Inside the string to be replaced...

I'd snap and send to you later
12/10/2020, 11:02 - +234 803 420 2314: Hmmmmm 🤔. Thank you

12/10/2020, 17:14 - +234 811 858 6001: How can I use clustering on an unlabeled data with more than 2 features?🙏
12/10/2020, 17:14 - +234 811 858 6001: Can I? If yes, any sample of python code?
12/10/2020, 19:28 - Francis Atoyebi: Use PCA to perform dimensionality reduction, reducing the features to 2 and visualize it, this will give you an idea of how many clusters to expect, if possible. Then you can use KMeans or other algorithms to perform your clustering...

Hello, pls when are we supposed to use a pseudocode instead of a flow chart
15/10/2020, 16:18 - +234 803 420 2314: Know what both mean and you get your answer
15/10/2020, 16:19 - +234 811 858 6001: 👀
15/10/2020, 16:21 - +234 803 420 2314: (In simple terms) 
- Flow chart is a diagramatic process yeah!
- Pseudo code is kinda same but in writen form more like outlining the steps to achieve your result

The shape of my dataset is 60000 × 28 × 28

It returned 17 × 60000 × 28 × 28 as the shape when passed to Pytorch DataLoader and iterated over.

My network expects the shape to be 17× 1 × 28 × 28 but  DataLoader returns 60000 as channel value instead.

18/10/2020, 17:42 - Francis Atoyebi: I'm trying to understand the code kindly interact with me, what is the iter function meant to do?

Cos I feel it's just loading all the images one after the other.
18/10/2020, 17:44 - +234 816 342 0137: Yes, it's meant to iterate it one after the other but it's loading all the images...train_loader is the variable name to DataLoader
18/10/2020, 17:53 - Francis Atoyebi: It's iterating it one after the other and saving them in that file.
18/10/2020, 17:54 - Francis Atoyebi: Try using a for loop and I feel it will solve your problem. But if you'd be saving it in the variable called dataiter, it will save all the images as one dataframe or whatever file type it is.
18/10/2020, 17:55 - Francis Atoyebi: You should reconsider
18/10/2020, 17:56 - Francis Atoyebi: Also, I don't think this is a bad sign to you training your algorithm except you want to do something else, cos you can still do your traintestsplit and you can also load the data into the Neural Network in batches or as a whole.
18/10/2020, 18:01 - +234 816 342 0137: Iterating over it causes my system to hang (memory overflow) that's why I used DataLoader
18/10/2020, 18:05 - Francis Atoyebi: What do you want?
18/10/2020, 18:06 - Francis Atoyebi: What do you want to do with your data?
18/10/2020, 18:59 - +234 816 342 0137: It's the MNIST handwritten dataset

20/10/2020, 21:10 - +234 803 420 2314: Someone is ending her call
20/10/2020, 21:10 - +234 803 420 2314: I tried again

20/10/2020, 21:13 - +234 703 160 7868: Does anyone know if she ever participated in the street protests?
20/10/2020, 21:13 - Muhammed: Yeah truecaller can't identify the number
20/10/2020, 21:13 - +234 703 160 7868: This is not good at all...
20/10/2020, 21:14 - Muhammed: Only noticed she changed her username to *sọ̀rọ̀ sókè babe*
20/10/2020, 21:14 - +234 816 631 6330: Same thing on Twitter
20/10/2020, 21:14 - +234 818 936 4697: I don't like this at all.
20/10/2020, 21:15 - +234 813 780 3722: Don't know if it is possible

Maybe we can get through to service provider, just to get her details...
20/10/2020, 21:15 - +234 816 398 2854: According i to reports, Alausa is next

You guys should stay safe

20/10/2020, 21:18 - +234 703 160 7868: Her several identities was always obscure here. No one really knew her name.
20/10/2020, 21:27 - +234 816 381 5935: The WhatsApp account is online but the number not reachable🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
20/10/2020, 21:28 - +234 703 365 7422: She just replied ooo

20/10/2020, 21:29 - +234 803 420 2314: She should find a doctor because she would be losing blood
20/10/2020, 21:33 - +234 902 044 0447: Hmmm
20/10/2020, 21:33 - +234 902 044 0447: She's alive and capable of moving.

20/10/2020, 21:36 - Muhammed: Please continue to engage her, if possible, try and get the contact of anyone around her 🙏

May God keep her safe 🙏
20/10/2020, 21:37 - +234 703 160 7868: Yes....there is no single network in that zone right now.
20/10/2020, 21:37 - +234 703 160 7868: Please kindly tell her to establish her identity first of all.
20/10/2020, 21:38 - +234 703 160 7868: Let her state her name and any of her relatives that can be called upon.
20/10/2020, 21:38 - +234 902 044 0447: I think she must have reached any of them before us

Now they want to start cyberwarfare  on social media. I discovered a problem: protesters taking pictures can be easily tracked using exif data 
Solution: a mobile app that can take pictures and have your exif data erased.

Now that most police stations are burnt & looted, let’s restrict our movement and prevail on our family members to watch theirs as well.

The looted arms are currently in the wrong hands, they’re moving freely now without restrictions especially since Police have been demobilized & traumatized. This is not the time to show off or be indifferent to people around us.

If you must buy, buy at a secure supermarkets/shops. Don’t open wide your wallets to show off the contents, give help if you can but only if it’s convenient...List your priorities.

Let’s check on ourselves from time to time and maintain good relationships with our neighbors and members of communities /estates. Let’s obey instructions given by govt and stay safe.

Let’s also remember to pray for our Nation, this is a very challenging times for us, May God heal our Nation and grant us peace.

26/10/2020, 22:23 - Muhammed: Just as I have realized sometimes ago, those recruiters are a bunch of funny human beings, some do copy and paste, without properly subjecting the content to proper scrutiny before posting.

27/10/2020, 20:45 - +234 703 036 4335: Hey There,

*I'm giving out 1,000 copies of my new book, I'm Employable (paperback) for free.*

Yes, you heard me right. A whole 1,000 copies for free. 

I will pay for the book while you pay for handling and delivery cost and the book will be delivered to you within 3 working days if you are in South West, Nigeria and in 5 working days if you are outside South West. 

The book current goes for N3,000 excluding delivery cost on vincentadeoba.com/iamemployable where you can also read reviews we received from our thousands of readers but I have decided to give out *1,000 copies* for free to help undergraduates and graduates understand what it takes to succeed in the corporate and business world of 21st century. 

All you need to do to claim your *free copy* is to send me a message on WhatsApp on +234 816 912 6032 or send an email to joytohumanity1@gmail.com.

This is my little way of contributing to the new Nigeria in the making where young people will be empowered with the necessary information and resources that they need to succeed. 

P.S - *Each person can only get a copy for free.*

*Please share, someone you know might need a copy.*

*#IamEmployable*

10/11/2020, 14:56 - +234 803 420 2314: I am not an excel guru but i feel you should use the 'text to column' feature
10/11/2020, 14:57 - +234 803 420 2314: Click on the data tab, there you will find the text to column. Then just like 'split' in python, you specify the character you want to split by
10/11/2020, 14:59 - +234 803 420 2314: Yours seems like ' â€" ' right? You may have to put that in your 'others' field
10/11/2020, 15:03 - Richie: We suppose do analysis of who is employed here and who needs employment... I think this is another reason community like this was created.... Am i speaking your mind 😊...
10/11/2020, 15:04 - Muhammed: Try these crude method
1. Copy the content to another column.
2. For start date; *=left('cell number', len('cell number')-13)*

3. For end date; *=right('cell number', len('cell number')-13)*
10/11/2020, 15:05 - Muhammed: NB:

13 used here is the number of characters (space inclusive) from either sides of the needed dates
10/11/2020, 15:05 - Muhammed: Date(s)
10/11/2020, 15:07 - Muhammed: 13 might not be uniform across the cells; hence, it's more advisable you use *power query* as rightly suggested by @2348108522573

11/11/2020, 02:36 - +234 816 342 0137: Code keeps throwing error: *only batches of spatial targets supported (3D tensors) but got targets of dimensions: 2*

Anyone faced with similar issues before?

 I've checked different sources but I still can't resolve it...the error is about my targets being multi-class as I need to one-hot encode it or so...this is not the first I'm working with a multi-class dataset (MNIST) but I don't know why the error is coming up now.
11/11/2020, 09:49 - Francis Atoyebi: How much is advised to propose as a data analyst salary from a top production company?
11/11/2020, 09:51 - Francis Atoyebi: A little urgent, if you have an idea.
11/11/2020, 09:55 - Muhammed: Level of seniority?
Entry Level, Mid-senior or Senior?
11/11/2020, 09:59 - +234 703 160 7868: Your experience should count and be a major lever in such conversations.

11/11/2020, 10:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: No depend on Glassdoor for Naija o 😂

12/11/2020, 13:21 - Muhammed: For Lagos to truly become a 21st-century economy, it must leverage the power of big data in connecting with its people.

A connected Lagos where data is constantly collated and analysed is the key to smarter policies that benefit all.

Can big data become the new crude required to oil the wheels of development? Can Lagos harness its tech equity in connecting the state to the citizen?

Art of Technology Lagos 2.0 will drive the conversation on big data and its role in creating a connected and smarter Lagos.

Kindly help me.

Thank you

27/11/2020, 14:08 - +234 905 074 5130: Hello Tosin.

Please how do I import a .xlsx file on MYSQL.
The file selector only allows for JSON and CSV
27/11/2020, 14:21 - Tosin Openiyi: Yes.... Just confirming that too
27/11/2020, 14:27 - +234 905 074 5130: I don't seem to know how.

27/11/2020, 14:29 - Olayinka: I have tried on some occasions to import a csv file but I get stuck at like 90 something%

27/11/2020, 14:31 - +234 905 074 5130: Oh wow.
Thank you
27/11/2020, 14:33 - +234 905 074 5130: But my team uses MYSQL. 
Will they still be able to access my script with the same output (due to the truncation I'm experiencing on MySQL)?
27/11/2020, 14:34 - Olayinka: I think there should still be a way
27/11/2020, 14:34 - Olayinka: Try to check on Stack oVerflow
27/11/2020, 14:38 - Tosin Openiyi: If you have MS SQL SERVER installed, it could also be a lifesaver
27/11/2020, 14:39 - +234 905 074 5130: I did .
This is the response I got.

 1) *show variables like 'sql_mode';* (it had strict mode on).
To disable it I used 

2)  *set sql_mode='';* 
To deactivate strict mood.


The above worked for a friend but doesn't seem to work for me.😔
27/11/2020, 14:39 - +234 905 074 5130: I might just do that.

02/12/2020, 20:14 - +234 817 965 1769: Exactly. New order
02/12/2020, 20:16 - Francis Atoyebi: okay... $1m?
02/12/2020, 20:18 - David Adeyemo: Well well...... Nothing is too big to charge tho.....

They are paying for your top notch service. But since you said they are big. 

Shoot you shot
02/12/2020, 20:18 - David Adeyemo: *your*

02/12/2020, 20:19 - +234 817 965 1769: Depends on the dataset and how good you are
02/12/2020, 20:19 - +234 817 965 1769: Designing skills too matter
02/12/2020, 20:20 - Francis Atoyebi: depends on the project and the data
02/12/2020, 20:20 - Francis Atoyebi: exactly
02/12/2020, 20:21 - +234 703 160 7868: You don't just charge for charging sake because of the company involved. You've to able to give them reason to believe why yiure charging at what rate. Do a practical breakdown and rate your service in per hour charging.
02/12/2020, 20:23 - +234 703 160 7868: This is important for their procuremnt department because they'll always reference it in future. Who knows if they don't already have similar proposals from other people that will offer that service.
02/12/2020, 20:24 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: How many days?
02/12/2020, 20:26 - +234 803 420 2314: Fellows, there is a difference between a power bi report and a power bi dashboard. Don't mix them up. Just saying
02/12/2020, 20:26 - +234 703 160 7868: Then in this case. He should first study the project brief and do an appropriate costing.
02/12/2020, 20:26 - David Adeyemo: True,  I thought I guess it's a one off project tho
02/12/2020, 20:26 - Francis Atoyebi: a week
02/12/2020, 20:26 - Francis Atoyebi: I know, its a dashboard
02/12/2020, 20:28 - Richie: Whata the difference..
Biko help us with pictorial facts.. Me i don't know sha
What i know is power bi dashboard and report in power point
02/12/2020, 20:29 - Richie: 🥴😎
02/12/2020, 20:29 - +234 817 965 1769: 👀👀👀
02/12/2020, 20:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Typically we charge client using the following factors;

✓ Hours to be spent on the project which will correlate to the number of days, number hours per day

✓ Experts to work on the project (Here you pitch your skills as a factor why you bid high)

✓Resources that will required for the project. Since you will be provided them with training materials and deliverables, you cost that too 

✓ External resource (Optional), if you will be using one 

✓ Lastly the reputation of those you will be delivery project too (this one na him be koko😂)


I can help you do the costing sha make you pay for consultancy fee 😂
02/12/2020, 20:31 - +234 816 677 6236: Please I want to know the difference too!! Thank you in addy
02/12/2020, 20:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Designing skill bi ti bawo
02/12/2020, 20:32 - Richie: E shock you...
🤣🤣
02/12/2020, 20:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: There is a difference
02/12/2020, 20:32 - +234 803 420 2314: https://www.educba.com/power-bi-dashboard-vs-report/
02/12/2020, 20:32 - Richie: I can create dashboard and report oh..
Na just the power bi report i need to see
02/12/2020, 20:32 - Richie: Ok thanks
02/12/2020, 20:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Stakeholders are interested in a dashboard they can see at first hand to get all the fact they need to make decisions, not time to go through details
02/12/2020, 20:32 - +234 803 420 2314: Thank you for this opeyemi
02/12/2020, 20:33 - Francis Atoyebi: mad ooo! Make I enter DM. The project is more than just dashboard. it has ML prospect too
02/12/2020, 20:33 - +234 803 420 2314: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
02/12/2020, 20:33 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Report go through details while dashboard at a glance just capture the important metrics and KPIs they want to monitor
02/12/2020, 20:33 - +234 817 965 1769: You can know how to visualize data. If your sense of color is poor, using wrong alignment, zero typography, etc


Some visualization are appealing than others.

I think there's a reason for that
02/12/2020, 20:34 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348108522573 has said it all. Same info as the link
02/12/2020, 20:34 - +234 803 420 2314: Yeah, color mixing and placement is key
02/12/2020, 20:35 - +234 703 160 7868: @2347037869165 This is the  template for a likely practical breakdown. Our prof. don answer am for you.🤲🏽
02/12/2020, 20:35 - Richie: Na wa..
02/12/2020, 20:35 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That is learnt via experience and over time na, you will only teach the basics to those you will be training, so I don't think that's a factor for costing
02/12/2020, 20:35 - Francis Atoyebi: aswear
02/12/2020, 20:36 - +234 803 420 2314: @2349058285150 what wa 😁
02/12/2020, 20:36 - +234 817 965 1769: This is what I mean by designing.

It's a principle in fundamental of designing called look and feel
02/12/2020, 20:36 - Francis Atoyebi: Thank you guys for your input! I believe I am almost good to go. God bless us all
02/12/2020, 20:36 - +234 817 965 1769: Oh no. I am not referring to the cost. 

I am referring to days it will take visualization project.

So I said dataset and how your designing stuff is good
02/12/2020, 20:37 - +234 817 965 1769: Time to cancel one tile to redo go reduce
02/12/2020, 20:38 - Richie: Plenty English na.... But thanks.... Watin Musa no go see for gate
02/12/2020, 20:38 - +234 817 965 1769: But if na learner like me, I can take two days still thinking of idea.

Lol
02/12/2020, 20:38 - +234 803 420 2314: Lol
02/12/2020, 20:39 - +234 817 965 1769: Two days that I am still thinking if idea somebody that's good would have finished two dashboard self
02/12/2020, 20:40 - Tosin Openiyi: Hope you guys are clear with the different between dashboard and report? 🤔
02/12/2020, 20:40 - +234 817 965 1769: So that's why I said designing skills too can contribute to time it will take
02/12/2020, 20:40 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348179651769  i will suggest you stick to white bg and then use complimentary colors for the charts (not more than 3 with exception to pie charts)
02/12/2020, 20:40 - +234 816 677 6236: No sir
02/12/2020, 20:41 - +234 816 677 6236: 🤓🙄Boss
02/12/2020, 20:41 - +234 803 420 2314: Ruq, a dashboard is more like a static page that shows only important metrics
02/12/2020, 20:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Bid well oo

Sweet mouth too 😂
02/12/2020, 20:41 - +234 803 420 2314: A report on the other hand is dynamic
02/12/2020, 20:42 - +234 816 062 6971: I feel you can charge any amount you like just depends on how well you can persuade them to pay it and to also see the worth/value it will add. It also depend on how big, big is different from big. It depends on what exactly they want you to do on the dashboard. You can use the value or what you think they can make from that dashboard on the long run to charge them.
02/12/2020, 20:42 - +234 817 965 1769: Or a summary of all reports. If it can be said like that
02/12/2020, 20:42 - +234 803 420 2314: Nah
02/12/2020, 20:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Persuade

This might help
02/12/2020, 21:06 - +234 803 420 2314: Thanks man
02/12/2020, 21:41 - +234 703 160 7868: Yeah while persuasion is a good thing. He also needs to be a bit careful with the way he'll go about that because there is a thin line between persuasion and begging to get the job(which isn't a confidence booster). But then he can still do away with the persuasion bit especially if he comes highly recommended by similar clients (this is where one can do some bit of shakara) or like you said pitch them the value of what they will stand to lose by not hiring your service.
02/12/2020, 21:42 - +234 816 062 6971: Another angle

10/12/2020, 12:40 - +353 87 112 3149: SQL

10/12/2020, 15:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So you want to return each column with their sum right?
10/12/2020, 15:13 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Without having to type them out ?
10/12/2020, 15:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If yes, you can using *information_schema* to retrieve all column names then loop over the columns to compute the sum using a stored procedure *sp_executesql*
10/12/2020, 15:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This is for SQL server though, so you may have to check similar syntax in the db you are using

10/12/2020, 18:16 - +234 810 414 8525: Please I'd like to know which software is preferable for analysis and visualization -- Tableau or Power BI?

10/12/2020, 18:54 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348108522573 please what is the usefulness of "Hadoop" or  ''Spark" as relates to data? No one has mentioned it here but I here about it every now and then.
10/12/2020, 18:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's Big data tools oo 

When you are talking about Data governance and warehousing involving Non-relational data.
10/12/2020, 18:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I've only had to work with Spark once sef for a client
10/12/2020, 18:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So it's not really something you want to learn in abstraction like that if you don't have the use case
10/12/2020, 18:58 - +234 803 420 2314: Okay, but does it have its own uniwue syntax or it uses existing platforms
10/12/2020, 18:59 - +234 803 420 2314: Okay thank you.

11/12/2020, 12:58 - +234 812 216 8133: Hi everyone, is it possible for Power BI to wrongly interpret a data type. Say displaying a number for a text data input
11/12/2020, 13:10 - Tosin Openiyi: Yes 💯 possible
11/12/2020, 13:11 - Francis Atoyebi: Yeah, you can even set that. Also, in setting you can tell power query to detect data types or not. Lastly, the first rows of a column in a dataset could be numeric but maybe down below there's a text in between, that column will be displayed as text.
11/12/2020, 13:13 - Tosin Openiyi: 💯
11/12/2020, 13:13 - +234 812 216 8133: Wow
11/12/2020, 13:13 - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks Francis. So when importing data into power BI, one has to always verifying the data types
11/12/2020, 13:15 - +234 812 216 8133: For your last statement, is there a quick way of detecting this without scrolling down the column(s)?
11/12/2020, 13:15 - Francis Atoyebi: Yeah or just go into power query and click on detect data type.
11/12/2020, 13:15 - Tosin Openiyi: You can use detect data types options in power bi but always double check to ensure that power bi detect the right data type....


Beware of the auto change type step... It may screw you up.
11/12/2020, 13:15 - Francis Atoyebi: Uh yeah, you can check the entries in the column by clicking at the down arrow beside the column name
11/12/2020, 13:15 - +234 812 216 8133: Okay. Once that is done, it can't make a datatype mistake right?
11/12/2020, 13:16 - Francis Atoyebi: Yes. If the data type is consistent along that column
11/12/2020, 13:16 - +234 812 216 8133: Hmm. Thanks for pointing this out. I am taking notes
11/12/2020, 13:16 - +234 812 216 8133: Alright. Thanks boss
11/12/2020, 13:17 - Francis Atoyebi: Lastly, power BI detects and profiles your data using the first 1000 columns most times, you might want to click on that info at the bottom of your power query screen and choose profile on all data instead.
11/12/2020, 13:23 - +234 812 216 8133: Wow. This is news to my ears. I am doing so right away. Thanks for pointing this out

14/12/2020, 15:48 - Tosin Openiyi: Time intelligence functions come handy whenever you want to do trend analysis (Year to Date, Month to Date, Same Period Last Year, etc)

P.S: There must be a date column in your dataset and you will need to create calendar date for this function to work seamlessly.

15/12/2020, 20:27 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Cole also have same perspective too, I got to discovered that perception about the chart when I first read the book and I was shocked and she wrote the book a long time o

15/12/2020, 20:40 - +234 818 936 4697: Many analysts hate pie chart especially
15/12/2020, 20:52 - Zainab Balogun: Pie charts are the information visualisation equivalent of a roofing hammer to the frontal lobe. 
They have no place in the world of grown-ups, and occupy the same semiotic space as short pants, a runny nose and chocolate smeared on one's face. 
They are as professional as a pair of assless chaps. Anyone who suggests their use should be instinctively slapped - Coda Hale 😅

15/12/2020, 22:22 - +234 812 216 8133: I get his point totally. Imagine representing Dele and Dayo with sales value of 18k and 19k respectively. The difference might not be obvious
15/12/2020, 22:23 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: *Her
15/12/2020, 22:24 - Tosin Openiyi: He's spot on 👌 but wetin man go do na. The presentation is boring at time when the dashboard is full of barchart (stacked/column) and for me that is where pie/Donut chart comes in, just to spice things up. But the categorical data point must not be more than 3 or 4 at most.
15/12/2020, 22:25 - +234 812 216 8133: Apt.
15/12/2020, 22:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yeah

I personally don't think it should be totally relegated 

Three (3) classes are okay
15/12/2020, 22:26 - +234 812 216 8133: her I mean
15/12/2020, 22:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: But funnily o I have never seen pie-charts  in any of McKinsey exhibits
15/12/2020, 22:26 - +234 812 216 8133: Is it just the number of classes or we should also factor the sizes too
15/12/2020, 22:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: They use bar and stacked chats a lot ehn
15/12/2020, 22:27 - Tosin Openiyi: I concur 🙌
15/12/2020, 22:27 - Tosin Openiyi: Cole is their mentor
15/12/2020, 22:27 - +234 812 216 8133: 🤔🤔
15/12/2020, 22:28 - +234 812 216 8133: 😄😄
15/12/2020, 22:28 - Tosin Openiyi: For proportion/ratio too?
15/12/2020, 22:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Like they use the bar charts so well ehn you will get all the Insights and information.


You have to even learn how to read Bar charts well if you must pass McKinsey PST 


Exhibits full everywhere with bar chart
15/12/2020, 22:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Guuuuy

They communicate it well with line chart/bar chart o with *text*

I doff 🙌🏿

15/12/2020, 22:30 - Tosin Openiyi: Data Visualization is boring for me if I'm only limited to bar chart 📊

Anyways, the priority is to pass the message across in a way that is simple and easy to grasp.
15/12/2020, 22:31 - Tosin Openiyi: I'm understanding baba.... Once you understand your audience, the rest is history.
15/12/2020, 22:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Message is the koko actually!

16/12/2020, 08:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Why the focus of becoming a Data scientist or because that's the fuzz around Between just to mention, it's over hyped too.

That said, since you claim to be a rookie then you can navigate the route;

Business Analytics  >> Data Analyst >> Data Scientist >> Happy exploration 

The first courses I usually recommend to anyone interested in explore the data world is the PwC course which I will say the best introduction course to Data world 

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pwc-analytics

@2348120919501  wrote an article on how to apply for financial aid here 

https://link.medium.com/pJ1AJcxh75


When you are done with that then we will know if you are ready to explore, you can reach out then. I wrote an article on my journey but I think if I had to start again with my little exposure, I will follow another route!


Happy data sleuthing
16/12/2020, 08:34 - +234 817 965 1769: Why is that if many people would start all over again they would follow another route?
16/12/2020, 08:36 - +234 817 965 1769: Opiano and Business 😂😂😂

Help your boys
21/12/2020, 14:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Halos 

Good afternoon everyone 😌

Just heads-up from this, so from the final responses checked some few minutes, it's glaring everyone want to rewind😭 myself inclusive, from 40 responses, 30 wanted physical and 10 virtual, but too bad that won't be possible giving the recent updates. That means we will opt-in for Virtual.

Just to make the it worthwhile aside the catch-ups and talks around setting the discussing learning plans and all, I'm thinking about having an Ask Me Anything (AMA) say for 30-45min where we get to ask a Recruiting Manager any questions we have around DS/DA relating to Job and beyong.

 I'm looking at talking to Dr.Dumebi Okwechime (Former Chief Data Scientist RenMoney) or Jania Okwechime (who happen to be my boss maybe I can use the privilege😂) or Danny Ma. Hopefully I'm able to pull them because I understand it's a busy season where most would want to relax, but would try and initiate the conversation with anyone we chose

What do you think guys?

Who among the trios do you suggest or incase you have another suggestion you can help pull, it will be much appreciated.

What date do you suggest though might have to work with the timing of the guest if they agree 

That's quick update 

Let drop our responses.

Man has been busy since 😭

Compliments of the season.
21/12/2020, 14:08 - +234 803 420 2314: Boss I am guessing from twitter he requested for his data or he scrapped the data using requests, scrapy, or selenium and then made use of word cloud also
21/12/2020, 14:09 - Muhammed: I remain loyal sir 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
21/12/2020, 14:10 - +234 803 420 2314: Oh! Like he said, he used the twitter api too.
21/12/2020, 14:10 - Muhammed: Yeah I requested the data from Twitter API. Guess some of us have a *Twitter Developer's Account*
21/12/2020, 14:11 - Muhammed: If yes, then a part of the problem is solved
21/12/2020, 14:12 - +234 803 420 2314: "A part"
21/12/2020, 14:12 - +234 803 420 2314: So what is the other part? 😁
21/12/2020, 14:12 - Muhammed: Yeah
21/12/2020, 14:14 - +234 803 420 2314: From the report, I see most of the tweets are basically from "FMCo...."
21/12/2020, 14:15 - +234 803 420 2314: And most of the followers tweet around 11pm....
21/12/2020, 14:15 - Muhammed: You'll need to write *power query* to make the request from Twitter, using the earlier created *Twitter API*
21/12/2020, 14:15 - +234 803 420 2314: Abeg help a brother learning 😁
21/12/2020, 14:16 - Muhammed: That's the last refresh time though 🥴
21/12/2020, 14:16 - +234 812 216 8133: Dr Okwechime  for me. The date depends on the schedule of whoever we decide to bring on board
21/12/2020, 14:17 - +234 803 420 2314: Is there a way you can write a cide to make the report to "auto refresh" at a certain time.....
21/12/2020, 14:20 - Tosin Openiyi: Hmmmm 🤔
21/12/2020, 14:20 - +234 803 420 2314: *code ----- no variable 'code' unpacking
21/12/2020, 14:21 - Muhammed: I haven't explored that yet 🥴, but a mere click refresh on your report either from *Power BI Desktop* or *the published report* updates the report immediately
21/12/2020, 14:22 - Tosin Openiyi: This is automation in 4-D 😁
21/12/2020, 14:23 - +234 803 420 2314: My opinion; your boss, Dania Okwechime
21/12/2020, 14:23 - Tosin Openiyi: Can we treat this with immediate alacrity? 🤔
21/12/2020, 14:24 - +234 803 420 2314: It can be done.
21/12/2020, 14:24 - +234 703 036 4335: Good afternoon boss

Jania Okwechime

S
21/12/2020, 14:24 - +234 803 420 2314: *Jania Okwechime @2348108522573
21/12/2020, 14:26 - Muhammed: Then, if you want to do a sentiment analysis on the tweets, you'll need to create a Microsoft Azure account, and then create a *text analytics* resource, obtain the API key for the resource.

Finally, you'll write another *power query* to get the sentiment scores of the tweet texts
21/12/2020, 14:26 - Muhammed: You can then proceed with the visualizations
21/12/2020, 14:26 - Muhammed: Jania Okwechime
21/12/2020, 14:27 - Tosin Openiyi: If you are a pro user, u can set/configure auto refresh in power bi service. The minimum is hourly. This will work seamlessly provided your data transformation is not complicated.
21/12/2020, 14:27 - +234 803 420 2314: So far, 3 respondents go with "Jania Okwechime"
21/12/2020, 14:28 - +234 803 420 2314: Yes! In Power BI service.
21/12/2020, 14:34 - Muhammed: Yeah, that's for a published report
21/12/2020, 14:50 - Muhammed: But for a report on your local machine, you still have to go by the way of manual refresh.

Not sure if *Power BI Gateway* makes provision for that sha. And also note that the auto-refresh works better (if not only) when your data source is online
21/12/2020, 15:27 - +234 817 965 1769: @2348110895622 can gateway solve the issue?
21/12/2020, 15:46 - Tosin Openiyi: Since your data source is on your local machine/on premises, installing and configuring Power BI Gateway is one of the processes to successfully setup auto refresh in power bi service.
21/12/2020, 15:50 - +234 817 965 1769: Okay. I thought as much and I was expecting someone to measure it
21/12/2020, 15:50 - +234 817 965 1769: Mention
21/12/2020, 16:05 - Muhammed: Unfortunately, I don't use Power BI Gateway, cos for the most time, I call my data from an online source. Hence, the need for the Gateway is defeated. My reports are set to auto refresh
21/12/2020, 16:05 - Muhammed: From my account settings
21/12/2020, 16:06 - +234 817 965 1769: ok
21/12/2020, 16:19 - Tosin Openiyi: Smart move Bro...
21/12/2020, 16:20 - Muhammed: 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
21/12/2020, 16:21 - Muhammed: I'm still learning though, let me try and setup the power BI Gateway, I might find it interesting to use sha
21/12/2020, 16:26 - Tosin Openiyi: If you want to pass this route, your local machine must be running 24/7 for the auto refresh to work.
21/12/2020, 16:27 - Muhammed: Better I keep my peace then
21/12/2020, 22:56 - +234 808 647 7661: Hello, pls anyone

21/12/2020, 23:17 - Francis Atoyebi: This message was deleted
21/12/2020, 23:17 - Francis Atoyebi: you need to assign a value to those variable names
22/12/2020, 05:56 - +234 803 420 2314: What I feel is, your 'have_umbrella and have_hood' should take boolean values. Your rain_level is already integer but you need to be sure how you want to use you 'is_workday' variable.

28/12/2020, 15:34 - +234 817 965 1769: Afternoon, 
Please if you have worked on Entity Relationship Diagram project using MySQL  before please DM.

There's a gig for you
28/12/2020, 18:46 - +234 817 965 1769: Can a linear regression model be negative.
For instance, you have a data. After doing the linear regression. You were given x value and you are to predict y. So after imputing necessary step you got negative value. Meanwhile y is about total money spent?

If it's possible to have negative value what could be the reason?
28/12/2020, 18:59 - +234 815 308 9036: It's possible to predict a negative value.

A linear regression model is basically just a linear graph and you can have your line cross the negative y-axis. Imagine predicting temperature during winter for a state in America, it's expected to be negative actually.

If you're having it for money, it would be insightful to plot a graph of x against y and see how it tends.
28/12/2020, 19:02 - +234 817 965 1769: It's for Money
28/12/2020, 19:06 - +234 815 308 9036: I know.

You'll need to plot your data and see how it trends.
28/12/2020, 19:06 - +234 817 965 1769: I have customer's income and total spending.

Given the income, I want to predict the total spending
28/12/2020, 19:06 - +234 817 965 1769: So I got wrong negative value
28/12/2020, 19:07 - +234 817 965 1769: I did ooo.
28/12/2020, 19:07 - +234 817 965 1769: Wrong is unnecessary addition sorry
28/12/2020, 19:11 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: @2348153089036  already answer you, so it's very possible for your LR to give negative estimate, however the concern here is do you think the negative predicted value is wrong or not expected for the target in view?
28/12/2020, 19:12 - +234 815 308 9036: Look at the values you're to predict.

Maybe there's an error there.
28/12/2020, 19:13 - +234 817 965 1769: I think is wrong that's why I am bother. 

I have done it using different ways, got same answer
28/12/2020, 19:15 - +234 817 965 1769: For instance the data given have this:

A customer's income is 43 dollar and spent 14 dollar.

So I have a customer's with 42 dollars and the y gave negative value. 

I was expecting something between 12-13 dollars as answer.

Just a similar example not really stuff
28/12/2020, 19:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Ooh
28/12/2020, 19:16 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Which Algorithm are you using? OLS?
28/12/2020, 19:18 - +234 817 965 1769: It's Excel data analysis tool
28/12/2020, 19:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: The tool pack?
28/12/2020, 19:19 - +234 817 965 1769: Yes
28/12/2020, 19:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Simple or Multiple linear regression?
28/12/2020, 19:28 - +234 817 965 1769: Simple.
28/12/2020, 19:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So how did you make your prediction??


You generate the Regression equation and input the values or how?

04/01/2021, 20:00 - +234 812 216 8133: 2019, I set up a WhatsApp group for mentoring young graduates, those serving and those done with NYSC. The intent was to guide them on how to navigate the tricky job market in Nigeria drawing from my experience and that of others.It was an entirely free service.

I ran 4 batches of about 50 cohorts each but I wasn't exactly impressed by the level of participation, I figured it is because the service is entirely free and people don't appreciate free things. This is a service I would ordinarily charge a 100K for and I wont even negotiate. The stuff I am dishing out is that good and will expose those folks to a whole lot.

I decided to stop it and guide people strictly on request, most of them cannot afford what I will charge. Afterall, when I ran it for free, it was taken for granted.

My friend Suraj Oyewale used his page on FB for stuffs like this and even runs a consulting company JarusHub for stuffs like this , I occasionally assist if there is a need but he left FB since last year for personal reasons and there has been a huge void.

I'm considering starting another one for some cohorts (<=50) and I am spelling out eligibility and other conditions in crystal clear terms.

1. Participant must be a graduate of a University, Polytechnic or equivalent( Has served , currently serving, looking for Job or looking to better his/her career lot)
2. Participant must be ready to participate actively in discussions, Tests, assignments and mock interviews and hand in all deliverables when due.
3. Age is not a barrier but ideal participant should be less than 40 as at last Birthday.
4. Engagement may be random due to availability of the facilitator but participant must respond to discussions within 10-12 hours worst case scenario
5. Participant will be removed from the group for not contributing and as such seen as not driven or serious.
6. Those expelled from the group are not eligible to re-apply for other batches.

Its a FREE Service and the mentorship covers:

1. CV Writing
2.Cover letter writing
3. Aptitude testing from Saville, SHL, Kenexa, Watson Glaser, Dragnet etc
4.Personality Testing
5.Job Interviews and mock Interviews
6.Case Studies from BCG,Bain, McKinsey,
7. Assessment Centres
8. Role Play
9. Analysis from Economist Magazine of events across the Globe
10. Emerging Technologies and Competitiveness in Job markets
11. Job Certifications
12. Job and Scholarship search
13.Presentation and communication skills

Anyone who desires to be a part of this or wants to recommend  someone should send a DM to me on FB, there are no guarantees that everyone will get a slot. It closes when I get to the number I seek.

Those who don't get a slot may have to wait for the next set of cohorts or when someone is expelled.

PS: Those who would like to mentor are also free to indicate, I am more than happy to add them so we can bounce ideas from them as well.
04/01/2021, 20:00 - +234 812 216 8133: Send me a DM if interested

Dr Sulaimon Afolabi: Data Science community will miss you

The founder of Africa4AI has left the world for the inevitable journey. Africa4AI is a pan Africa organisation founded in 2019 by Dr Sulaimon. He has been a great mentors to many people in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelliegence. As I received the news of your departure, it burdens my heart if though the fact remains that we are ll going to test death.

He's also a tutor and mentor in Data Science Nigeria and to some other Data Science / Artificial Intelligence community. Dr Afolabi's wealth of wisdom has been a great source of motivation for most of us.
.
Indeed we will miss you.

11/01/2021, 08:04 - +234 803 464 8863: Good morning, Data Gurus. I hope we are well.

Please for people asking, it’s just one exam you need to sit and pass to earn this. That is the DA-100 (Analyzing Data with Power BI) certification exam from Microsoft. It’s $80 but if you have an exam voucher from your company, it’s free. I sat mine from home 2 days ago - scheduled the exam for 9 PM but it didn’t start up until 9:30 PM, finished few some minutes past 11 PM. 56 questions, time allowed was 150 minutes. It had 4 case studies. 

The only study resource I used a bit while prepping were documentations from Microsoft Learn platform. 95% of the knowledge applied were from my knowledge of the solution itself. 

P.S: All the arguments/debate you can have *for* and *against* getting certifications especially in a tech. industry like ours are all valid. So if you want to get some certs, please do. If you want to focus on upskilling, please do. Don’t just get certs without knowing the solution.

Thank you ✊🏽

18/01/2021, 12:20 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348179251327  I will suggest you put the states (6 in your case) in a list and assign to a variable then, use the *'is in'* method of filtering in pandas. You should get your output.
18/01/2021, 14:24 - +234 817 925 1327: Thanks
18/01/2021, 14:24 - +234 817 925 1327: I have resolved it using. Apply

18/01/2021, 21:24 - +234 703 397 0467: Evening everyone,

Please I need help with GITHUB. Google or YouTube isn't helping me rn.

I'm working in a team on a project. A git repo is shared, I do create a new branch on the same repo and push my commits on that branch without affecting the main branch
18/01/2021, 21:30 - +234 816 398 2854: Fork the repo
Clone it into your system
Create your branch
And push
Create pull request

You should be good to go
18/01/2021, 21:32 - +234 703 397 0467: The push seems to be the issue as I have done the 1st 3 steps successfully.

18/01/2021, 21:38 - +234 816 398 2854: You've not set upstream branch yet
18/01/2021, 21:38 - +234 816 398 2854: It's still just on your system
18/01/2021, 21:39 - +234 816 398 2854: Do this instead...
18/01/2021, 21:39 - +234 816 398 2854: git push --set-upstream origin _branchname_
18/01/2021, 21:40 - +234 816 398 2854: git push --set-upstream origin enigmire

18/01/2021, 21:45 - +234 902 233 9854: Pull from the main/master first
18/01/2021, 21:46 - +234 902 233 9854: If the pull works and the push error still persists you can force a push(if you really need to get it done rn)
18/01/2021, 21:47 - +234 902 233 9854: Otherwise, just try a 'soft' reset and start from staging and committing
18/01/2021, 21:48 - +234 703 397 0467: I did a pull yesterday and the error still persist.
18/01/2021, 21:48 - +234 703 397 0467: I will do this
18/01/2021, 21:56 - +234 816 398 2854: Omo there's conflict here as it seems

If the 'no confirmation" is because the data no exist at all across all clusters, then you know the answer. Error msg will be sent.

22/01/2021, 14:57 - +234 803 420 2314: Hi fellows
22/01/2021, 15:08 - +234 803 420 2314: Please @2348108522573 and @2348110895622 and @2348120919501 how much SQL is required for a data analyst to know?

For example, I know the data query language is mandatory for a data  analyst/scientist but, is it 'very important' to know indepth the others since the description of an analyst is different from an administrator, a DB developer, or an operations personnel.
22/01/2021, 15:09 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Know the basic to scale through an interview and when you get in you will know how much you need to know.
22/01/2021, 15:10 - Olayinka: You can't know all of this thing at a goal
22/01/2021, 15:10 - Olayinka: It comes with working handons and experience
22/01/2021, 15:11 - +234 803 420 2314: Are you sure? 😁
22/01/2021, 15:11 - +234 803 420 2314: I absolutely concur
22/01/2021, 15:11 - Olayinka: Like Ope rightly said, know the basics well enough. You will learn on the job. In fact, in my current job, I have not had to use SQL.. Had to pick it up recently not to get rusty
22/01/2021, 15:11 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348108522573 by 'the basics' please what exactly do you mean?
22/01/2021, 15:11 - Olayinka: Moreover, you will always have help here
22/01/2021, 15:12 - +234 803 420 2314: Of course you fellows are too sure (in baba ijebu context)

Which is windows function?
22/01/2021, 15:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If I ask you aggregate and return the 2nd item base on rank you can’t solve that if you don’t know *windows function *
22/01/2021, 15:15 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Na this thing cast me during one Interview 😭😭😭😫😫

22/01/2021, 15:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: OVeR() 

You see PARTITION BY as a common clause use
22/01/2021, 15:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I forgot to add 

CTE - Common Table Expressions too.
22/01/2021, 15:19 - +234 803 420 2314: Okay.
22/01/2021, 15:20 - +234 803 420 2314: Does this mean 'regular expression'
22/01/2021, 15:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Nah.
22/01/2021, 15:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: More like Subqueries
22/01/2021, 15:21 - +234 803 420 2314: Oh
22/01/2021, 15:21 - +234 803 420 2314: Queries within queries
22/01/2021, 15:21 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: They make interacting with multiple tables easy and increase performance
22/01/2021, 15:22 - +234 803 420 2314: Thank you for the clarity, i did not want to waste my time studying what may not be necessary or the function of a DB developer.
22/01/2021, 15:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Make sense.
22/01/2021, 15:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Just know the basic to pass an interview

22/01/2021, 15:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yeeeeeah

It’s a great one.
22/01/2021, 15:25 - +234 803 420 2314: Anyway, I am of the opinion that, rather than using *LIKE '%ope%'*, it is better to use *REGEXP*
22/01/2021, 15:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: LIKE is deficient when you have large data
22/01/2021, 15:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It will run out of memory or stop
22/01/2021, 15:26 - +234 803 420 2314: Please is it free 😁, or do you have a coupon code? @2347085316273

28/01/2021, 14:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: To learn DAX first go and watch YouTube on filter/evaluation and row context, once you understand that concept the rest na formular.

When you understand that go on YouTube and search for Curbal and watch some of her DAX beginners series.
28/01/2021, 14:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: When you have a clear understanding the rest na google ooo and Microsoft documentation. 

Microsoft documentation still be best sha since they are the owner. If you know how to read documentation then that’s all you need.
28/01/2021, 14:33 - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks, Opiano, I really appreciate your input

A telematics company approached us at AI Saturdays Lagos for a Data Scientist to join them. Please see the job description below and fill the form that follows if you are interested in the opportunity. 

Job Description: 

What We Do:

Tsaron Tech is a telematics company building a scorecard system to help auto insurers determine what's good or bad driver behaviour. Bad drivers pay dearer premium or receive fewer benefits.

Why We Need the Data Scientist:

We recently completed a noncommercial test run with continental auto insurers. We need the detailed data scientist to test and structure thought frameworks out of datasets generated from the test run against a research-focused metric we're working on for the scorecard system. This metric is one out of several others we're tracking & building for the scorecard system. The data scientist will likewise work with auto analysts and software engineers on these other metrics. However, the focus of this engagement is the research-focused metric and the goal of the engagement is empirically establishing through data modeling the metric as a standard in the scorecard system.

What Makes a Hire:

The position is an open offer. Tsaron Tech will offer employment to the first data scientist to empirically establish through data modeling the metric as a standard in the scorecard system.

WHATSAPP NEW POLICIES AND THE IMPLICATIONS

Whatsapp is owned by Facebook, which also owns Instagram. Whatsapp has become the defacto standard for communication amongst mobile device users. Whatsapp can be used to sent text and other forms of media. You can use it to send you location, contact and even make sales using the Business version.
Whatsapp has become an integral part of our digital lives and many cannot do without the services that are provided by Whatsapp. Over 2million people use whatsapp and are satisfied by the features and security offered by the app.

The level of security however seems to be questionable as Whatsapp has released new terms and conditions that would take effect from the 8th of February,  2021. These conditions however do not affect users in the United Kingdom or EU as they are protected by data protection law.
 The debate here is:
1. What are these terms and conditions?
2. Should you be concerned?
3. What should be your next line of action?

• WhatsApp has updated its policies to include certain levels of sharing.
• On February 8, 2021 (two days from now) the app will force everyone to accept the policy if you don’t accept before then.
• Every user has to accept the policies or delete their accounts

WHAT ARE THESE CONDITIONS and WHAT DO THEY IMPLY?

Just incase you do not have the patience to wait through my analyses and observation, you can scroll to the summary at the end of this class:

Read through the New Policies below

SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?

Let's point out the policies and see how they affect us...

1. Access to location data: the new policy for location has to do with sharing location with users. You would not be able to share location with others unless you grant access to your location data. According to Whatsapp…. “We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use location-related features, like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you.” However, even if you turn off your location in an attempt to stop this, Whatsapp can still guess your location using your IP Address.

2. Data Sharing:  The policy also states that data will be shared with Facebook Companies, Facebook own Instagram, Onavo and Crowd Tangle. It simply means that your data will be accessed by these apps and more. The data that whatsapp can collect includes device data like hardware model, browser info, IP address, phone number, device indentifier and Operating system info. They also will have access ot your battery level, signal strength, app version, language and time zone.

3. Data Collection: Whatsapp will collect data for analytics, these data will include how you use whatsapp, how you interact with others, time spent on whatsapp and duration too. Information about your groups, profile photo, about information…in fact most of your information would be collected.


4. Payment and Transaction data:

 Concerning transactions, if you use any of Whatsapp payment services for purchases or other financial transactions then your account will be required. There is a plan to make Facebook, Instagram and messenger and whatsapp to

5. Other issues:
Whatsapp will store users data (messages and media) on their server for 30 days if undelivered.

Whatsapp will no longer make non-whatsapp users identifiable!

Now, having read all this, should be scared? 
If all the data and privacy issues listed above are of no value to you then you shouldn’t. if they are then you should.

WHAT SHOULD BE YOUR NEXT LINE OF ACTION?

You should be weighing your online presence and how much you want to reveal, especially if you are using your personally identifiable information (PII) on these platforms. For those of us in the UK, you might get the necessary cover from the data protection law that exists but you an bet that African countries are susceptible to data encroachment in any dimension.


You might decide not to accept the New Policies but you have only till Monday, 8th of February 2021 and then you wont have an option anymore. It becomes compulsory then.


It is up to you to decide how much you value your privacy against your need to use the services of Whatsapp and the facebook companies.

SUMMARY:

• If you live in the UK and you only chat with people within the country or you are outside the UK but very comfortable with how Whatsapp has always been in terms of data and security then you do not need to change. Just accept the conditions and go on with your life.


• If, however you are outside the Uk and you are not confortable with the new terms and conditions then I advise you to leave Whatsapp and port to other applcations like Telegram and Signal app.


• If you are also someone who work with privacy details, an activist or a whitleblower of any dimension then you shouldn’t even be on Whatsapp in the very first place, if you are… PORT NOW! And wipe clean your slate!


Concerning privacy, if you use Facebook, Twitter and any of the Google platforms, Android, Gmail and co then you shouldn’t be discussing privacy here! Yes, you are already in the compromised party.

WISDOM LANE
Today you might not consider privacy as important but in the digital space, it is very important. Your information is YOU!

If you reveal too much, you might not be able to control the effect. The internet never forgets. Some think it twice.


If you do not have much too lose and you do not have anything to secure per say then utilize you normal online protection and live well!

09/02/2021, 16:39 - +234 803 420 2314: Hello everyone, good evening
09/02/2021, 16:42 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348108522573 @2347085316273 @2348120919501 please I have a question; which is best to use as relates to performance and readability  amongst subqueries and joins?
09/02/2021, 16:49 - +234 708 531 6273: Joins are well optimised than subqueries(especially correlated subqueries).

Corr. subqueries are a messy way to join data. It becomes complicated and inefficient when you are trying to join 3 or more tables. 

That is my own view sha. You might find it cool.
09/02/2021, 16:50 - +234 803 420 2314: I don't
09/02/2021, 16:50 - +234 803 420 2314: In other words, no difference between both right?
09/02/2021, 16:50 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol
09/02/2021, 16:51 - +234 803 420 2314: I can quietly stick to understanding joins 💯 and stick to that yeah?
09/02/2021, 16:52 - +234 803 420 2314: No time for over-assimilation this year, that was 2020 style
09/02/2021, 16:53 - +234 708 531 6273: Yes. But there might be other use cases for corr sub-queries apart for joining tables. The problem on the ground determines the approach.

But if it is for the sole purpose of joining tables, join is the best
09/02/2021, 16:56 - +234 803 420 2314: I need to know, why must an analyst learn to understand how to perform analysis in sql when the data can just be gotten and exported to excel, power bi, or python
09/02/2021, 16:57 - +234 803 420 2314: Is it not enought to just fetch the data? Why is there a db-admin?
09/02/2021, 16:59 - +234 803 420 2314: Anyway, I would like to know but still going to proceed further though. I am finding the subquery a lil difficult and that is holding me from moving to window functions
09/02/2021, 17:01 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Voted
09/02/2021, 17:02 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. What about a situation where the company doesn't have a DB admin? 😂
09/02/2021, 17:02 - +234 708 531 6273: 🙌🏽
09/02/2021, 17:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You may need to understand that too sha cos you may require the use.
09/02/2021, 17:02 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If e no Dey nko
09/02/2021, 17:02 - +234 803 420 2314: I would ask they get one because I am an analyst

09/02/2021, 17:04 - +234 803 420 2314: But please, an explanation would be most welcomed wrt subqueries
09/02/2021, 17:06 - Obinna Iheanachor: In my case for example, the database hosts data for branches of the company in different countries.

You'll need to write SQL queries in Power BI/Excel to filter for data relevant to your country.

Else you might wait a very long time if you are loading all the data.

This is just one use case of knowing SQL. Several others abound.
09/02/2021, 17:10 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Voted
09/02/2021, 17:10 - +234 708 531 6273: Think of it this way.

Non Corr sub queries


SELECT age 
from(
Select the most beautiful,age from this group ) 

*The second select is a sub query that is independent of the first select statement. I.e The second SELECT statement will return a table of the most most beautiful girls in the group and their age. While the first SELECT statement will pick just the age from the second select statement which is now acting as a table for the first select statement

09/02/2021, 17:17 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Just calm down. Follow the course one step at a time. 
Don't try to finish it at once.

20/02/2021, 19:54 - +234 817 925 1327: Is it possible to use seasonality to predict response time or leadtime?
20/02/2021, 19:55 - +234 817 925 1327: It would be more good if I can have a conversation with someone about it that's why I asked.
20/02/2021, 19:58 - Richie: Now he has spoken.. Biko help him out..
20/02/2021, 19:58 - Richie: I can try but we need expert 😊
20/02/2021, 19:59 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That will be dependent on the problem you want to solve if seasonality influences the target
20/02/2021, 20:01 - +234 817 925 1327: It does
20/02/2021, 20:01 - Richie: If lead response time refers to a metric that gauges how long it takes to follow up with a lead that has contacted a business (either by calling, emailing or filling out a form) then i don't think you should use it.. But to conclude this what type of Business is this?
20/02/2021, 20:01 - +234 817 925 1327: According to the domain people i spoke with in the office
20/02/2021, 20:02 - +234 817 925 1327: Haulage
20/02/2021, 20:02 - Richie: Then nature of the business can overrule my opinion.
20/02/2021, 20:02 - +234 817 925 1327: Ok
20/02/2021, 20:03 - Richie: Use seasonality then.
20/02/2021, 20:04 - Richie: But others should talk oh.
20/02/2021, 20:04 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If it does base on domain knowledge then you will factor that in and that implies when splitting your data to train you won’t use the conversation train and test with split randomly but you have to segment differently to train on.

22/02/2021, 20:48 - +234 803 353 6901: This?
22/02/2021, 20:48 - +263 77 847 7813: Here 52.6% of the respondents are willing to pay between 200-499naira for the service
22/02/2021, 20:50 - +263 77 847 7813: There is a link between the color key and the number of people (percentage) that are willing to pay a certain amount (within range) for the service

23/02/2021, 16:05 - +234 817 925 1327: Does it make sense to use check relationships between seasons and time?
23/02/2021, 16:07 - +234 817 925 1327: Basically what I mean is,  I came up with a metric based on time, that is,  it was gotten by subtracting two time fields and I intend to see how season affect this manipulated variables.
23/02/2021, 16:08 - +234 817 925 1327: In equation,  Response time = Request time - acceptance time

My first question-

Hi Mojeed, so let’s start 🙄😭😂😂 (no even play or introduction)

“If God exists, and you sin, you go to hell but if you don’t sin you are good. And if God does not exist, and you sin, you are good but if you don’t sin you are also good but you missed some enjoyment/freedom. What is your expected behavior using probability 😬😬😬”

01/03/2021, 12:09 - +234 905 362 9860: This one off me

01/03/2021, 12:10 - +234 816 062 6971: That one is small.
That was first stage.

When I read about the interview online, I was so scared. I used Glassdoor to prepare
01/03/2021, 12:10 - +234 816 062 6971: A lot of rejects

01/03/2021, 12:12 - +234 816 062 6971: An the funniest stuff is that one is not allowed to use calculator during their interviews 
And they give a lot of tough mental calculations
01/03/2021, 12:14 - +234 905 362 9860: Sigh... The fact that you were able t even secure an interview says a lot about your resume

01/03/2021, 12:15 - +234 816 062 6971: 1. If you are allowed to place a bet based on rolling two 10 sided dices and the sum of what you roll is what you win. What is the expected throw to win the maximum bet. I was asked to do this mentally.

2. What is the volume of what in all the oceans?
01/03/2021, 12:16 - +234 905 362 9860: This is high level quant reasoning.
01/03/2021, 12:16 - +234 816 062 6971: Ahhhh 
No whyne me 😭😭😭
01/03/2021, 12:18 - +234 706 839 0583: Please what the answer to question 2😕

I caught you 😂😂
01/03/2021, 12:19 - +234 816 062 6971: I knew the answer then but it doesn’t have any specific answer 
It’s called guesstimating 
They just want to see how you reason around tough problems because quantitative traders do a lot of mental reasoning on the spot
01/03/2021, 12:20 - +234 905 362 9860: This thing dey give me headache as I dey read am😪

Check Glassdoor for tougher questions 😂🥴😂
01/03/2021, 12:21 - +234 905 362 9860: There's no correct answer actually, they jus want to walk through your analytical reasoning process
01/03/2021, 12:21 - +234 812 216 8133: Oya guesstimate for us
01/03/2021, 12:22 - +234 816 062 6971: You might have to think of 
- earth as being spherical
- the percentage of the earth covered by water
- the volume of a sphere
- the radius of the earth 
And many others
01/03/2021, 12:23 - +234 706 839 0583: Hmmmmm quite  a lot to reason on.

12/03/2021, 14:22 - Muhammed: Succinct 💯

You might also have to read on the difference(s) between ETL and ELT, and where each is applicable
12/03/2021, 14:23 - +234 708 531 6273: No SQL (mongo DB, elasticsearch etc), Shell scripting and command line, ETL, Python and/or Java, SQL and database modelling. 
Question can come from any of these
12/03/2021, 14:23 - +234 708 145 1890: OLAP, OLTP too...

Which sector is the data engineering, it matters.
12/03/2021, 14:24 - Mayokun: Oga o😕
12/03/2021, 14:25 - +234 708 531 6273: Wooo that department is messed.  I just remember that you also need Apache spark for data processing and Apache Nifi or Airflow for pipeline management and automation
12/03/2021, 14:26 - Mayokun: Lmaooo, what🤨
12/03/2021, 14:26 - +234 708 531 6273: Lolzzz. You never see shumtin
12/03/2021, 14:27 - +234 708 531 6273: It is even worse if you will be the one to merge the data from different sources and store in a reservoir. You might need to also know teradata or Oracle atunity
12/03/2021, 14:28 - +234 708 531 6273: Truly data science is sexy
12/03/2021, 14:28 - +234 708 145 1890: Can it get to this stage, in Nigeria tho?
12/03/2021, 14:28 - Mayokun: It’s an intern role.....
12/03/2021, 14:29 - +234 708 145 1890: Spark is for big data streaming.

12/03/2021, 14:30 - +234 708 531 6273: Yes, in banks. In my bank we generate over 8 million rows of USSD data per day.
12/03/2021, 14:30 - Mayokun: They only mentioned SQL in the description
12/03/2021, 14:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Na wa!
12/03/2021, 14:30 - Mayokun: All these ones y’all are listing, I’ve never even heard of them 😄
12/03/2021, 14:31 - +234 810 878 6913: Can't someone learn all these on the job?
12/03/2021, 14:32 - +234 708 531 6273: Oh you come dey let me waste my energy since 🙄

Basic SQL and python plus the drive to learn is all you need
12/03/2021, 14:32 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Yes actually.
12/03/2021, 14:34 - +234 708 145 1890: Yes, I know.

First Bank should be more.
But I didn't know they used Spark for it. Cool.

Surely, Teradata, Finnacle and Oracle.
12/03/2021, 14:34 - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, MS SSIS is cool to.
12/03/2021, 14:35 - +234 708 531 6273: Yeah. Pandas will crash few seconds into the analysis.
12/03/2021, 14:38 - +234 708 145 1890: 😅

True... I have a few questions, if you don't mind?
12/03/2021, 14:41 - +234 810 878 6913: Alright. Thank you

The guy that first asked the question mentioned it I think.... sorry but thanks for the info🤗🤗
12/03/2021, 14:51 - +234 905 362 9860: Anyone that relates with this should kindly indicate
12/03/2021, 15:03 - +234 905 362 9860: I’m trying to carry out some bioinformatics analysis on the result gotten from a bench work. The aim is to determine if the clusters formed using ML would tally after sequencing. 
I have used K-means and hierarchical clustering methods however I realized that I have to determine the number of clusters to be formed with those, hence, I can only employ them when I have references samples. 

According to the research made, I need to take an unsupervised clustering approach, where the machine determines the number of clusters based on the pattern it is able to identify from the data.
12/03/2021, 15:04 - +234 905 362 9860: Any help or recommendation🙏🏼
12/03/2021, 15:19 - +234 708 531 6273: Okay go on
12/03/2021, 15:23 - +234 812 216 8133: All these things dey give me headache 😭
12/03/2021, 15:37 - +234 708 145 1890: On which Operating system do you use this frameworks.

Then as data engineers, with this frameworks, you convert the data and then move into data repositories which can now be spooled out for analysis right?

No on the fly analysis?
12/03/2021, 15:57 - +234 708 531 6273: 1. In production they are run on Linux servers. You can also install on your Windows servers but most of the time they run into dependencies and patch update problems.

2. There is data at rest analysis and there is data streaming analysis.
For data streaming, you will need to use Apache Kafka or Spark streaming in your pipeline to be able to do on the fly analysis. If not, there will be latency problem and your analysis won't be real-time. 

So as your data is gushing in, Kafka will act as the container to help you hold together or aggregate the data before the analysis is carried out on it.
12/03/2021, 15:59 - +234 708 531 6273: So in essence, there is data at rest analysis and on the fly analysis. Any problem you have, the Apache foundation has a tool for you.
12/03/2021, 16:26 - Richie: It depends on the company definition od DE.. This days data engineering JD deu off me but it can include postgre, mysql, data lake, red shift, mongodb and families 😂, cloud, Azure and family.. I hope you are ready for such role?..

I would like to seek recommendation on the use of Microsoft SQL server studio or MySQL workbench  for a beginner in SQL.

Or which best database platform and learning resources one can leverage.

Thanks for your time.
16/03/2021, 18:39 - +234 803 420 2314: I just feel it is a matter of personal preference or organisation requirement.
16/03/2021, 18:45 - +234 708 531 6273: I will advise you use Microsoft SQL server . Most large Companies use either MSserver or Oracle db. Familiarizing urself with any of the two will help in the future
16/03/2021, 19:38 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: SQLServer actually.  

I’ve only come in contact with Oracle & another db once with my clients majority Na Microsoft
16/03/2021, 19:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Good evening

Good to be back 😀
16/03/2021, 19:42 - Tosin Openiyi: I seconded 🙌

& you can transfer the ms sql knowledge to other dbms seamlessly.

16/03/2021, 21:33 - +234 708 531 6273: About 95% similar 
SQL programing is almost the same across all relational databases. If you learn SQL using Oracle, the same query will work on Postgresql,Microsoft Server , mysql etc 95% of the time. There are just little differences . The differences  should be your least worry ryt now

24/03/2021, 14:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Good afternoon all
24/03/2021, 14:30 - +234 810 878 6913: Pls, I want to ask a question
24/03/2021, 14:31 - +234 810 878 6913: What's the difference between an Azure data scientist and a data scientist
24/03/2021, 14:31 - +234 810 878 6913: I hope my question is clear sha🤔🤔

24/03/2021, 14:39 - Olayinka: Ehm.. Azure is a cloud platform I guess...

In my head I am thinking

A Data Scientist that can use the Azure platform 😌
24/03/2021, 14:40 - Olayinka: Like use the Azure platform for different DS work..

Like AWS Machine Learning Specialist... Using AWS services for ML work
24/03/2021, 15:15 - Muhammed: This summarizes the answer
24/03/2021, 15:27 - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you
24/03/2021, 15:28 - +234 708 145 1890: I agree with you.

Azure houses a lot of Analytics and AI capabilities, from Azure ML to LUIS to SQL & NoSQL dbs and even data streaming.

So and Azure Data Scientist is more like a cloud based (Azure in this case) Data Scientist.

Note, Python and/or R scripting are still necessary (tho it seems you can use a lot of no/low code on Azure).

A Data Scientist (regular abi standard) most times works on premises with your local system and resources. Meaning, the DS can custom build anything and everything.

If the need be, the DS can leverage on Cloud Structures to scale computing and/or storage resources.

But all in all, Data Scientist na Data Scientist abeg.
24/03/2021, 15:28 - +234 810 878 6913: How about the normal data scientists, that use Python
24/03/2021, 15:30 - +234 810 878 6913: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love that last part.

24/03/2021, 20:12 - +234 812 216 8133: Since correlation doesn't imply causation, is it safe to say that causation implies correlation?
24/03/2021, 20:16 - +234 907 429 6313: Hmmmm
It's beyond dt semantics 
Cos if you go to causation, you implying effect and impact, you start talking of regression (linear, multivariate) and co
24/03/2021, 20:17 - +234 907 429 6313: Correlation sometimes might be spurious, no link between two variables. But for causation there as to be a link

This time around, I wrote a post titled " *Life Cycle of A Data Science Project*, " where I demystified data science and talked about the lifecycle of a typical data science project. 

The post is a good read for individuals looking to understand what data science means and for organizations looking to adopt data science. Find the link below.

29/03/2021, 21:13 - Muhammed: Why the focus of becoming a Data scientist or because that's the fuzz around Between just to mention, it's over hyped too.

That said, since you claim to be a rookie then you can navigate the route;

Business Analytics  >> Data Analyst >> Data Scientist >> Happy exploration 

The first courses I usually recommend to anyone interested in explore the data world is the PwC course which I will say the best introduction course to Data world 

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pwc-analytics

@2348120919501  wrote an article on how to apply for financial aid here 

https://link.medium.com/pJ1AJcxh75


When you are done with that then we will know if you are ready to explore, you can reach out then. I wrote an article on my journey but I think if I had to start again with my little exposure, I will follow another route!


Happy data sleuthing

03/04/2021, 00:10 - Olayinka: We write on behalf of Diversiboard. One of our Directors, Professor Eleanor Brown is a member of the faculty of The Pennsylvania State University, which is the ninth largest university in the United States. In her time there, she has served on many committees and in various appointments, and in this capacity has had significant exposure to well regarded recruitment firms in the United States. As a result, she has come to recognize that there is an extraordinary range of job opportunities not only within the central Pennsylvania region, but in the Midwest more broadly. Importantly, she has also identified that these job opportunities have proven to be resistant to downsizing despite the ongoing pandemic, due to their ability to be done remotely and the ongoing scarcity of technical talent in the U.S. labor market.

 

Ms. Brown has an opportunity to introduce well qualified candidates to some Fortune 500 companies, and while there are no guarantees, the conditions appear favorable for many candidates to be hired. There will be two phases to this process. In the first phase, candidates who are deemed to be most attractive will be introduced to some of these companies. We believe that you might be an appropriate candidate for the first phase. In the second phase, a broader pool of candidates will be introduced. 



Please note that there is no cost to candidates. Should candidates ultimately be placed, any compensation to Diversiboard will come from the companies at which they are placed.



Resumes and supporting documentation may be uploaded at diversiboard.com. On the website, we provide a sample resume and detailed guidance on how candidates might best present their credentials and job experience.  We suggest that candidates closely follow these guidelines. 



Please respond to let us know if you might be interested. Please also follow our specific instructions and upload your resume and supporting documentation on diversiboard.com



With thanks, 



Eleanor Brown on behalf of Diversiboard

Hello, fam, 

It's my birthday 🎉 🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽
12/04/2021, 08:18 - +234 803 381 8401: Happy birthday bro, in pray for u many more prosperous years ahead, in health,wealth and Peace. Enjoy ur day🥳🎂🎼

12/04/2021, 10:57 - +234 703 461 5552: *True Situation Analysis of Life.*


After Secondary School..
All your classmates  gone in different directions in the world.

Some have completed universities and are now:
Doctors, 
Engineers, 
Teachers, 
Pilots, 
Lawyers, 
Administrators, etc.

Some are married, 
Some have given birth,
Some are still searching and waiting on the Lord.
Some are dead, don't forget that too.

And others are on the sick bed,  
Some are running their higher degrees: Masters, PHD, etc.

Some haven't even gained admission into the tertiary institution and may NEVER be able to.

Some own companies, 
Some are now Directors and major  shareholders in global companies.

But how do you feel 
When you meet your classmates, and it seems like he/she has accomplished their   dreams 
And you're not yet close to yours? 
So many thoughts run through your mind, right?
First, you think God has not been fair to you.

How about the ones you meet on the street wearing dirty cloths  and still struggling for survival ? 
Do you get the same thoughts running through your mind?
I guess, NO.

Don't forget too that some are already dead.  
Somehow it feels natural to have that  feeling of jealous for those mates who seem better off,  but it is really unnecessary.

There is no room for regrets,
We are all different and our paths to greatness are also not the same in distance.

Some might have arrived earlier before you and some  after you, but whatever level you find yourself in life, 
Please keep trying to break limitations and move further.

Celebrate the success of others, its an indication that yours too shall surely come.

Your friend buys a car now, be happy with him/ her. 
Remember when you'll buy yours, 
theirs might not  be the latest again.
There's no permanent champion, but current champion.

Life is not about competition, do not be in a race with anyone; remember,  we may seem to be reading the same book but different chapters at different times.

Don't let the passion in you  kill the desire in you, keep it burning. 

What you're  passing through today;
Write it down because one day the world would be ready to read it,  they'll become part of your success story.

There's no height you cannot attain, believe in yourself, define your goals,  recognize distractions and don't stop striving.

Spend time teaching yourself, because those things that mainly take people to the top are the things they devoted their time to develop.

Don't be intimidated by your friend's    success, the sky is wide enough for birds to fly without touching one another. 

Value every little thing that God brings into our life, love God and obey Him. 
For with God, all things are possible.

*Now to those who are on top Never forget to give a helping hand to those who are down.Because Life is full of uncertainties; the one you pull up today, may be the one to hold your hands and prevent you from falling tomorrow*

A piece of advice there, food for thought Share this to all your friends and let them realize that God has a purpose in their lives.
May God bless you.

Your charge rate /hour will determine.  That's the best way to charge.

19/04/2021, 10:32 - Muhammed: Thumbs up bro ✌️, the course is indeed a great one for a refresher for someone who is already in the industry (if you seek to unlearn and relearn), while it's also a good one to start with for a newbie/enthusiast who seeks to join the industry.

I'm also on the specialization course. Completed the course one last week, and should complete the course 2 in the coming days.

My special interests are in *R & Tableau*. Haven't worked actively with R for some years now.

19/04/2021, 10:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I've been on it since the first week it was released though but no time, so I try to do 20min every day before I start my days work and it helped out. 

And maybe because I enjoyed the flow of the course since I could relate with it from my day to day work it make it easy to follow through, so I don't know if that will be the case for others though.

Also, I downloaded the app which makes it easy to follow on the go
19/04/2021, 10:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's a good one

22/04/2021, 14:05 - +234 802 279 0760: Please i need some help. My MD asked me to come up with a detailed report on data and analytics in nigeria. 

I'd welcome every help i can get please.
22/04/2021, 14:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What about data and analytics in Nigeria?
22/04/2021, 14:08 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Or that's all he told you?
22/04/2021, 14:09 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If yes, consult further on what his expectations are and what he is looking at achieving
22/04/2021, 14:09 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: This will guide your solution approach
22/04/2021, 14:11 - +234 802 279 0760: Well it's about data and analytics but he wants to center the scope around financial services.
22/04/2021, 14:11 - Muhammed: Was about typing this 👆.
You need to get the specifics he'll be needing in the report. Data Analytics cuts across many sectors. Hence, if he could list his expectations, that'll guide you through the task.
22/04/2021, 14:12 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Still vague though
22/04/2021, 14:12 - Muhammed: Swears
22/04/2021, 14:12 - +234 802 279 0760: the key players, the challenges, the size of the industry.
22/04/2021, 14:13 - +234 802 279 0760: 😭
okay, what kind of parameters do you expect?
22/04/2021, 14:17 - Muhammed: You'll need to make some inquiries about the companies in this sector. How have they been performing time? The challenges they've been facing, and the one they might be faced with in the future. If you can also get data on the ratio of companies in the financial sector and other sectors.
22/04/2021, 14:17 - Muhammed: NBS might be a good source here (not so sure about this though ☹️)
22/04/2021, 14:20 - +234 802 279 0760: i'm on it.
22/04/2021, 14:20 - Muhammed: Knoema won't be a good source for the task at hand, as they only give summary data and not comprehensive data.

Their data is country specific and doesn't really drill down sufficiently into states/provinces you might be interested in
22/04/2021, 14:21 - Muhammed: https://knoema.com

Nevertheless, you can check it out.
22/04/2021, 14:21 - +234 802 279 0760: are there many data analytics companies like that in nigeria?
22/04/2021, 14:22 - Muhammed: Sincerely speaking, I don't know whether to say yes or no. Cos they all claim to be doing data analytics
22/04/2021, 14:22 - +234 802 279 0760: My approach is to look at the statistics of the top data companies according to google.
22/04/2021, 14:22 - +234 802 279 0760: hopefully, they have published financial statements..
22/04/2021, 14:23 - Muhammed: @2348108522573 do you remember that woman from FCMB saying there's sufficient data in the country, and they're waiting for people to come for it during the 2019 DSN Bootcamp?
22/04/2021, 14:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: All financial institutions have their FS published both the unaudited and audited ones because regulation expect them too, I'm only just curious on what you need them for
22/04/2021, 14:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I sincerely still don't have a full grasp of what you want to achieve as it tie to your Boss request. 

I should you define your request with him well sha, both of you should know what the end goal and expectations are so you don't waste energy in the wrong direction
22/04/2021, 14:26 - Muhammed: Yeah, I guess he/she actually need to highlight the metrics they're looking for.
22/04/2021, 14:28 - Muhammed: The problem/task should be well-defined.
22/04/2021, 14:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Lol

Company actually have data it's just how relevant the collected data are which makes Data science a hype at the moment in Nigeria. 

We need more of Data Engineers if you ask me than DS then we will be ready to start enjoying analytics and DS.  We still dey play 😀😀
22/04/2021, 14:29 - Muhammed: We're together on the voyage to the land of DE 😉☺️
22/04/2021, 14:29 - +234 708 145 1890: Rightly said.
22/04/2021, 14:30 - +234 708 145 1890: We gather dey 🤭
22/04/2021, 14:30 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: <Media omitted>
22/04/2021, 14:30 - Muhammed: Yeah they do have data, but the relevance of the data is what actually matters to us the consumers of the data.
22/04/2021, 14:31 - +234 802 279 0760: the metrics are basically the size of the market, the top players and the challenges of the top players.
22/04/2021, 14:32 - +234 708 145 1890: Of Data Analytics companies/firms in Nigeria?

Like Data Analytics Consulting yeah?
22/04/2021, 14:33 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Check out KPMG report on "Nigeria readiness for Data analytics" , I think that should give you some direction
22/04/2021, 14:33 - +234 802 279 0760: Yeah.
22/04/2021, 14:33 - Muhammed: Now I guess the task is becoming clearer. But then, when you talk of top players, you need to define which area(s)/aspect of finance as well.
22/04/2021, 14:33 - +234 708 145 1890: 👌🏾
22/04/2021, 14:34 - Muhammed: Here's a guide, check it out
22/04/2021, 14:34 - +234 802 279 0760: I'm on it already boss.
22/04/2021, 14:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: https://home.kpmg/ng/en/home/insights/2019/06/assessing-the-maturity-of-data-analytics-capabilities-in-nigeria.html
22/04/2021, 14:34 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: There you go
22/04/2021, 14:34 - Muhammed: 👍 ✌️
22/04/2021, 14:37 - +234 802 279 0760: I just want to say I really appreciate all your contributions.
22/04/2021, 14:40 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I believe the report will give you information on his request because you can't get an actual data in any repository regarding Financial service data analytics adoption in Nigeria, the only source of data will be  primary through direct contact with the players to ask questions and all
22/04/2021, 14:41 - +234 802 279 0760: We asked 162 respondents how they rated 
their organization’s competitive ability in 
D&A. 28% said they were leading in D&A, 
63% said their competitive ability in 
data & analytics was developing, while 
9% considered their organizations to be 
lagging in D&A capabilities.
Of all organizations who consider themselves 
to be industry leaders (top 10% ), 45% were 
seen to be leading in D&A, 53% developing 
and 1% said they were lagging. We see Data 
& Analytics as a new source of competitive 
advantage. It’s either you are doing it to 
survive, or you get left behind. There is no 
middle-ground.
Further insights revealed 80% of respondents 
in the financial service industry rated their 
D&A capabilities as developing.
22/04/2021, 14:41 - +234 802 279 0760: I wish i could know who these companies are.
22/04/2021, 14:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So the report will give you the answer your boss need, just cite the report in your documentation
22/04/2021, 14:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Data privacy bro
22/04/2021, 14:41 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's Ethical Analytics in place
22/04/2021, 14:41 - +234 802 279 0760: Yeah so he has given me this before. I just received it.
22/04/2021, 14:42 - +234 802 279 0760: Wàhálà. How will I bow know what companies to get statistics about?
22/04/2021, 14:44 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Loool.
That's why I said defining expectations is important so he is aware what is possible or not.
22/04/2021, 14:44 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: You can't get the company
22/04/2021, 14:45 - Muhammed: Datahack4fi days 😄
22/04/2021, 14:46 - Muhammed: *Ethics and Laws in Data and Analytics*
22/04/2021, 14:46 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: What you may also want to do is list out some Tier 1 or 2 FIs and surf the internet regarding latest information and adoption regarding Analytics
22/04/2021, 14:46 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That may give you some direction
22/04/2021, 14:48 - +234 802 279 0760: Yeah I'm doing that but my issue is getting information about D&A for these FIs.
22/04/2021, 14:50 - +234 703 160 7868: Is it about the use cases as it applies to different sectors? Is it more more recent updates in the industry? It could be about anything really, but you need an outline to guide you.
22/04/2021, 14:51 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Exactly
22/04/2021, 14:52 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's why I said it's vague
22/04/2021, 14:52 - +234 703 160 7868: Lol...GDPR will like to have a word with you.🌚
22/04/2021, 14:52 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂😂

22/04/2021, 14:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: @2348022790760 

I think to manage your boss expectations because the reality is many see analyst as magicians thinking you have all the answers, so what I think you can do is explore the report, do other research and document your findings and staring the limitations regarding other insights that may he may be interested in
22/04/2021, 14:58 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Letting him know the options available to getting the information
22/04/2021, 15:00 - Muhammed: As in, I designed a survey form late last night for someone, and I stated that we'll be complying with NDPR 2019, bàbà say make I commot am, I jejely request his email credentials, created another form using his email and handover to him.

No time to check time 🙅‍♂️
22/04/2021, 15:01 - Muhammed: A survey that collects a lot of personal information about the respondents for that matter fà
22/04/2021, 15:13 - +234 802 279 0760: please how would i get information on the proportion of these companies's revenues that are generated from data analytics?
22/04/2021, 15:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Sincerely you can't know from the face value on the FS that are published because it's an information for internal use which means the only person that can make such information available is the CDO/CIO or any the executives which isn't for public consumption unless if a third party like yourself engage then in the form of survey or interview to get those information which get published by Forbes or other recognized sources
22/04/2021, 15:26 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: If say Deloitte meet 10 top managements of different clients and conduct those interviews and they give us the information even when we publish the info we can't mention the name of the client, we will only say we interviewed 10 different stakeholders if different organizations and these insights were obtained

27/04/2021, 23:39 - Olayinka: This can't be true
27/04/2021, 23:39 - Olayinka: Well, is the scale over 5.0
27/04/2021, 23:39 - Olayinka: Or over 7.0
27/04/2021, 23:39 - +234 802 916 2599: She is talking about gpa not cgpa
27/04/2021, 23:40 - Muhammed: Another factor to check
27/04/2021, 23:40 - Olayinka: Oh.. GPA.. Okay
27/04/2021, 23:40 - Olayinka: She is right
27/04/2021, 23:40 - Muhammed: Yeah just noticed that
27/04/2021, 23:41 - Olayinka: She is wise.. She for talk the CGPA 🤣
27/04/2021, 23:41 - Muhammed: CGPA was wetin de my mind 😂😁
27/04/2021, 23:41 - Olayinka: But I feel it is the message of the growth and improvement she is trying to pass
27/04/2021, 23:41 - Olayinka: Kudos to her
27/04/2021, 23:42 - Muhammed: I for fear 😱 🏃‍♂️
27/04/2021, 23:44 - Muhammed: Yeah she did Great 👍.

I was just concerned about the *GPA* stuff. I was seeing *CGPA* earlier 😄😁 reason I had to consult my bosses here especially Andrew @2348160626971 NG to ask if it's possible, so I can enroll for another Bsc sharpaly 😂
27/04/2021, 23:46 - Olayinka: 🤣🤣
27/04/2021, 23:47 - Muhammed: Yes ó, so I can change my certificate to a first class 😂😅
28/04/2021, 00:00 - +234 808 647 7661: It's impossible to finish with 5.00 for 3.92 is too low. She has to constantly get 5.00 all semesters to grad with 5.00
28/04/2021, 00:01 - Muhammed: She typed *GPA* and not *CGPA*
28/04/2021, 00:02 - +234 808 647 7661: better
28/04/2021, 03:39 - +234 816 062 6971: Exactly 
Another possibility is she starting as a diploma student.
If she passes the requirements, then she gets into 200 level and starts with fresh GPA and CGPA (I am sure about this for Unilag but I don’t know about other schools)
You can correct me, because I am not really sure if they use GPA/CGPA to grade diploma students.
28/04/2021, 03:58 - Tosin Openiyi: Is this 5.0 out of 5.0?
28/04/2021, 05:28 - Muhammed: I'm not sure about that, and she's being careful about her choice of words *GPA* and not *CGPA* 😁
28/04/2021, 05:48 - +234 817 957 3641: She cant finish with a 5.0 CGPA if she got a 3.92 at any point lol. She could even get a 4.99999 but not 5.0 😂 
She kuku put GPA
28/04/2021, 06:26 - +234 706 942 4890: I guess she meant she started with 3.92 at first then maybe improved to having 5.0. Whereby her last semester/semesters was 5.0
28/04/2021, 08:19 - +234 810 878 6913: I just tire for the babe oo
28/04/2021, 08:37 - +234 703 160 7868: There is really nothing to be tired about. I didn't see where she claimed her CGPA was a perfect 5.00. She is just excited about her achievements and that's it. But my own is why all that shalaye and unnecessary emphasis on the GPA? 🤷🏽‍♂️Anyway it's LinkedIn and it's expected.

Until she starts to solve real life problems with her abilities. Let someone tell her the jury is still out there waiting to pounce.🏃🏽‍♂️
28/04/2021, 08:40 - +234 708 531 6273: She can actually. 

If you study engineering in unilorin,  your 100 level CGPA won't be used to compute your final/graduating CGPA. 

Your real cgpa starts from 200 level.
28/04/2021, 08:40 - Muhammed: 😬🥶
28/04/2021, 08:42 - +234 708 531 6273: Same for medicine and surgery (mbbs)
28/04/2021, 08:42 - Muhammed: Unilorin na boss ó
28/04/2021, 08:44 - +234 708 531 6273: They are not well. 
It makes graduating with a first class difficult. 100 level courses are the easiest. 

They are basic mathematics and physics we did in secondary school.
28/04/2021, 08:47 - +234 816 062 6971: Same as coming in through diploma for Unilag
The easiest way to finish as BGS or with a 5.00 is coming in through diploma. Your CGPA starts counting from 200 level
28/04/2021, 08:49 - Muhammed: Awesome 🥰
28/04/2021, 08:50 - Muhammed: For my own Futmx, even those who graduated with distinctions/upper, joined us at 300L through DE still chop breakfast 🍳 😂😅😄
28/04/2021, 08:52 - Muhammed: Ọmọ you go fear Futmx if you come in through DE, them go fist serve you breakfast 🥣 😄😅. You fit come adjust subsequently sha 😁

28/04/2021, 09:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Not CGPA

GPA is just for a session or semester. She def Can't have a CGPA of 5.0. So I guess her lowest GPA was 3.92 which she was able to hit the 5.0, so I think the statement isn't flawed, if she has said CGPA then na disguise
28/04/2021, 09:00 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 👍🏿

28/04/2021, 11:39 - +234 808 647 7661: That's what all other grades would be calculated upon. It's the backbone
28/04/2021, 11:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Less distraction because you don't know anyone so you can easily face your triangle life and Ace everything

Also, there is an aspect that involves studying you lecturers
28/04/2021, 11:39 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 🥴🤒

29/04/2021, 11:24 - +234 802 279 0760: I'm working with Visual Studio sir, not Pandas.
29/04/2021, 11:24 - +234 802 279 0760: abi is there a way i can run a python script in VS?
29/04/2021, 11:24 - +234 708 145 1890: Yes, there is.
29/04/2021, 11:24 - +234 802 279 0760: besides, i think it's already in date_time. that's why the 12am nonsense is displayin. 😡
29/04/2021, 11:25 - +234 708 145 1890: I use VSC tho, but I know you can do Python development in VS
29/04/2021, 11:25 - +234 802 279 0760: 🥴
29/04/2021, 11:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yes na

29/04/2021, 11:34 - +234 803 420 2314: Yeah. If he/she doesn't use that and there are errors, a syntax error may be given. But that takes care of the bad values. 😁
29/04/2021, 11:36 - +234 803 420 2314: Change the type to 'python' on the bottom right side of your screen and I also recommend you create a virtual environment
29/04/2021, 11:55 - +234 816 062 6971: A lot of ways
What of simple string slicing
29/04/2021, 11:57 - +234 816 062 6971: Use str(the date)[:10]
29/04/2021, 11:58 - +234 816 062 6971: str converts it to readable string in contrast to repr which leaves it as is in datetime
29/04/2021, 11:58 - +234 802 279 0760: I'm using Visual Studio. I don't know where or how to write Python Script on Visual Studio.
29/04/2021, 11:59 - +234 816 062 6971: There are many other standard ways
29/04/2021, 12:00 - +234 812 216 8133: Google this na. You can write Python in VS. But you have to select a language or something
29/04/2021, 12:00 - +234 812 216 8133: Our use Jupyter instead
29/04/2021, 12:03 - +234 816 062 6971: And if you want to convert back to datetime
Use fromisoformat
29/04/2021, 12:05 - Tosin Openiyi: from datetime import

You can read the problem statement and think it through even if you are unable to write the syntax yet

So i have a Visual Studio Problem.

I and my colleagues created different Solutions on our different computers on Visual Studio; now I want to merge all the Projects together on my own computer...
Please how do i do this? Please note that we are all connected to different servers.
05/05/2021, 11:08 - +234 803 420 2314: VS Code is it? If yes, there is an extension 🤔 called 'remote servers' or so, I guess that should help you. But also, don't forget your friends; Google, Quora, and Stackoverflow. Ensure you type the exact *keyword* in which you require a solution.
05/05/2021, 11:11 - +234 802 279 0760: I've been on YouTube since morning before coming here.
05/05/2021, 11:12 - +234 803 420 2314: Hmmmm
05/05/2021, 11:12 - +234 803 420 2314: Rephrase the keywords you use
05/05/2021, 11:15 - +234 803 420 2314: Install the extension 'remote ssh' and understand its use

06/05/2021, 14:45 - Tosin Openiyi: 💯

Once your data is well structured and formatted, you can take advantage of several gnatt chart custom viz in power bi
06/05/2021, 14:47 - Tosin Openiyi: You will need a power bi account to download the custom viz... I can help you with the download if you did not have power bi account

I have a table containing 2 different columns as the measure value. What I want to do is to have a filtering icon that will be used to show rows of data where the first column of the measure value is lesser than the other column and another filtering icon that will be used to show rows of data where the first column of the measure value is greater than the other column.

07/05/2021, 09:36 - Francis Atoyebi: but if you want as a filter, I think you will need to create a new column in your table to do a comparison and return something like higher or lower then, you will use that new column as the filter.

07/05/2021, 12:28 - +234 802 279 0760: SQL is the equivalent of English Grammar in Data Science imo. With a good knowledge of English Grammar, you can write great speeches and deliver eloquent lectures. In the same vein, with a good knowledge of SQL, you can write complex queries that might not even be in tutorial videos to navigate your way around and solve complex problems.

07/05/2021, 12:42 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: When I get stuck with an SQL project I know the issue is lack of understanding of what I need to do, so the moment I understand the English of what I need to do it's easy to reverse engineer to getting the syntax to get it do.

I guess understanding the English is where the problem solving come

07/05/2021, 21:15 - +234 803 420 2314: Who needs crypto? 😁 Abi make I run airdrop for una ni? Studied d market since February last year and know the in n outs
07/05/2021, 21:16 - David Adeyemo: Do short course for us
07/05/2021, 21:17 - +234 803 420 2314: Anyway @2348108522573 window functions ain't easy oh, I guess I would just follow the post about #SQL being pure English and look from that perspective.
07/05/2021, 21:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Just see Windows function as a way to work with your data and manipulate on a row basis
07/05/2021, 21:18 - +234 803 420 2314: The major thing you all need to know right now is, it won't make sense to purchase Bitcoin precisely unless you are Dangote
07/05/2021, 21:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Anything that involves row they are your best shot. 


You can do same problem without them but you will write lengthy code and lot of subqueries and nested joins.
07/05/2021, 21:19 - +234 803 420 2314: So it is more like the row-context (sumX, averageX) thingy in power bi
07/05/2021, 21:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Exactly
07/05/2021, 21:20 - +234 803 420 2314: 😎
07/05/2021, 21:20 - +234 803 420 2314: But Ope I wanna ask eh
07/05/2021, 21:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: But they give more flesh than the iterators of DAX
07/05/2021, 21:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Yes boss

07/05/2021, 21:21 - +234 803 420 2314: Does it really matter how you achieve a solution to a task or the final output?
07/05/2021, 21:21 - +234 803 420 2314: If I write 50 lines of query but get the desired output nkoh?
07/05/2021, 21:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: When learning for now just be concern on how to solve the problem, that way you are developing your problem solving
07/05/2021, 21:22 - +234 803 420 2314: 😎😎😎😎😎
07/05/2021, 21:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: As times goes on it will no longer be about result bit efficiency
07/05/2021, 21:22 - +234 803 420 2314: Thanks
07/05/2021, 21:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Performance.  

Why write 15lines of code when 3 lines of code will get it done and fast
07/05/2021, 21:23 - +234 803 420 2314: I get this absolutely though
07/05/2021, 21:24 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I've worked on a project for a client mehn my code legit was running 1hr 🥴🥴 , getting the result but efficiency bad until I stumbled on one article on Clustered Index
07/05/2021, 21:24 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Omoo 1hr turn 10min
07/05/2021, 21:25 - +234 803 420 2314: If only there was a precise guide on what and what not to learn when faced with a new technology
07/05/2021, 21:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Lool
07/05/2021, 21:25 - +234 803 420 2314: Wow!

07/05/2021, 21:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I have sha completed Week 1

I should play with some of Week 2 tonight
07/05/2021, 21:29 - +234 818 368 5814: I’m not receiving anything o
07/05/2021, 21:31 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I don't get
07/05/2021, 21:32 - +234 818 368 5814: Where are you gettiing the challenge questions?
07/05/2021, 21:40 - +234 803 420 2314: So Ope, u see bah this days an analyst does things similar to a dbadmin why is that? I keep hearing everywhere that the major strength of a data scientist should be SQL; why? When sql can't visualize...
07/05/2021, 21:44 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348086477661 except you are willing to hodl for a little long period to get profit, what's the point? As it is now, bitcoin fluctuates between $51k and $57k majorly so how much do u intend investing and what profit do you forecast over a certain period of time?
07/05/2021, 21:46 - +234 818 368 5814: Because you use sql to query database so as to get the dataset you need for you Analysis project
07/05/2021, 21:49 - +234 803 420 2314: Altcoins on the other hand, keeps growing somedays, by over 60%. This is what Nigerian should focus on more.
07/05/2021, 21:50 - +234 803 420 2314: Thanks Ace
07/05/2021, 21:51 - +234 803 420 2314: ETL, yeah.
07/05/2021, 21:53 - +234 808 647 7661: Cool though
07/05/2021, 21:55 - +234 808 647 7661: I'm lost
07/05/2021, 21:56 - +234 803 420 2314: Subqueries and joins do similar things (if not same), so why not just stick to one and master thoroughly 🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️
07/05/2021, 21:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's not the same o
07/05/2021, 21:57 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: It's different
07/05/2021, 21:58 - +234 803 420 2314: Just trying to reiterate the fact that many Nigerians have lost out on making profit via bitcoin
07/05/2021, 22:00 - +234 803 420 2314: U see why I always say Americans are silly because they keep creating languages and technologies when we haven't even heard of some. Soon now, they will say Julia (pluto and neptune nonsense) is better than jupyter. Mtchew
07/05/2021, 22:02 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348108522573 please can you just give a very brief use-case of their similarities/differences?
07/05/2021, 22:02 - +234 818 368 5814: Julia is a programming language if I’m right..

Jupiter is formed from Julia, Python and R according to one resource I read sometimes ago
07/05/2021, 22:04 - +234 803 420 2314: I came across a tutorial sometime ago that stated n I quote "joins and subqueries are alike but in the context of the problem, it may be better to use the one that makes you write less queries"

*NB, I rephrased
07/05/2021, 22:06 - +234 803 420 2314: Meant comparison with  python though and d notebooks neptune/pluto n jupyter
07/05/2021, 22:08 - +234 818 368 5814: Oh
07/05/2021, 22:11 - Tosin Openiyi: Tell dem ooooo...

Data Structure and Algorithm is an important concept everybody should try to have basic understanding as it helps to develop your problem solving skills. Also, understanding Data Structure and Algorithm helps you to write efficient code.

However, more often than not, beginners find it very difficult to understand while some who have prior coding experience don't like discussing it.

In this news letter, I will be simplifying the concept of Data Structure and Algorithm for you irrespective of your level. What you just need is to subscribe and always ensure you read the contents. Before you know it, you'll master the concept of Data Structure and Algorithm.

08/05/2021, 20:14 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: @2347085316273 

Do you write core Unit Testing as you work or someone else does?
08/05/2021, 20:16 - +234 708 531 6273: Kilon je be ?
08/05/2021, 20:17 - +234 817 965 1769: Lol
08/05/2021, 20:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: 😂
08/05/2021, 20:18 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: More like a way of testing pieces of your code maybe as you build each fraction of your pipeline
08/05/2021, 20:19 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I just wan sabi base on how you work currently
08/05/2021, 20:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: They including Unit Testing in the Data Engineering track I'm following and that stuff boring , I just dey doze steady
08/05/2021, 20:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So I just want to have the end in mind, like at what point you integrate that
08/05/2021, 20:22 - +234 708 531 6273: Of course nah. 

But there is no much "seren seren" like software dev. 

Just test as you write. You will have to switch off different functionalities sha so as not to get frustrated.
08/05/2021, 20:22 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Ehn ehn
08/05/2021, 20:23 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: So na softdev the whole serenren plenty
08/05/2021, 20:24 - +234 708 531 6273: I think the course must have factored in collaboration with software dev teams . I have never collaborated with  such team before
08/05/2021, 20:25 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: I know the part of test as you write which is like what I do normally but just getting Introduced into that aspect of Unit Testing integrated as a module

I have a question which is:
After one uses cross validation, how does one get the model parameters?
10/05/2021, 14:59 - +234 812 216 8133: Bosses in the house. Anyone knows how I can change a date type from DDDD-MMMM-YYYY to MMMM-DDDD-YYYY in Power BI? I can't find that option in the drop down menu
10/05/2021, 15:03 - Tosin Openiyi: Power BI default date settings is inherited from your local machine date.

To change the format, you might need to change your regional settings from options and settings or change the data type in power query editor.... Select local and select the location with the date format of your choice.
10/05/2021, 15:06 - +234 812 216 8133: Alright, boss. What about custom date type? Does that work too?
10/05/2021, 15:07 - Tosin Openiyi: This is a lot...

More simpler approach...

Setting the date column in thr fields section....

Go to the Model view....

Select Custom in the Date time format of the formatting section...

Change the Custom Format to the format of your choice...
10/05/2021, 15:08 - Tosin Openiyi: Yes... This is more straightforward.
10/05/2021, 15:09 - +234 812 216 8133: Thank you, boss. I really appreciate

You can check some of the comments of the post. Solid points.

14/05/2021, 18:36 - David Adeyemo: 💯

As one rise in career path less of Technical intelligence, more of people's skills(Emotional Intelligence).

Just a perception

14/05/2021, 18:55 - +234 808 647 7661: That's my perception...

Most leaders use Emotional Manipulation as the dark side of Emotional Intelligence... To Manipulate others in a wrong way
14/05/2021, 18:56 - +234 808 647 7661: Leaders with a high degree of EQ have used it to manipulate others to behave in a certain way.

14/05/2021, 19:05 - +234 808 647 7661: So, the data could give u what it previously doesn't seem to have.
14/05/2021, 19:05 - +234 808 647 7661: They are voting EQ ... Of course that's what they would vote for. Everyone pretends to have EQ as a means of Manipulating ppl to blv it is more important (I'm not saying it's not), but majority of them  lack it

14/05/2021, 19:08 - +234 816 062 6971: Even bargaining price at the market is EQ
The buyer and the seller are playing mind games. The seller gives a first price that is way beyond the actual price, then you too try to reduce it so well depending on you foreknowledge about the stuff you want to get or about how they behave

14/05/2021, 19:10 - David Adeyemo: Basically, we all apply EQ in everything we do. 

We just need to be conscious of how we used it to manipulate others. Just a thought.
14/05/2021, 19:10 - +234 808 647 7661: EQ has a spectrum
14/05/2021, 19:10 - +234 816 062 6971: Do you know that most people get scared to ask for favor because they don’t want to get rejected
The truth is that, the more you ask, the more you get and surprisingly you might not get rejected at all. You are meant to even intentionally ask to get rejected so you can get used to rejection

15/05/2021, 22:19 - Muhammed: 2% growth for Instagram*
15/05/2021, 22:33 - +234 803 420 2314: Over the period of 3years, the chart shows a decline in conversion with respect to ad spend on Google Search, Youtube, and Facebook with Google Search experiencing a major decline of 4% which shows that, the expected  engagement ratio to ad spend isn't yielding results as expected.

Amazon and Instagram on the other hand, shows positive growth over the span of the 3-year period with Amazon having a major increment of 6% within these period. 

I would recommend that, targeted ads should be primarily centered around Amazon and Instagram as the charts has shown more conversions from these platforms and also justifies 'our' organisation's ad spend as yielding results.
15/05/2021, 22:34 - +234 803 420 2314: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 all this grammar just to say *"let's focus more on _Amazon_ and _Instagram_"*. Chai!

15/05/2021, 22:48 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348179651769  if you check out the title of the chart, it relates to the ads effectiveness. I would say, not necessarily 'google search', it is whether or not ads placed on google search is having conversions with respect to how much being spent to place the ads there. 

*Digital Marketing*; most people just use google to get what they want and rarely click an advertisers link. But Amazon and Instagram is more of a 'direct' marketing thingy (if you get what I mean sha)

15/05/2021, 23:29 - +234 703 160 7868: Just to be clear. This is not decline in usage. It refers to ad spend and there are a number of factors that may have been responsible.
 
• High CAC leading to high cost and therefore leading to adverisers seeing the platform as being cost ineffective 

•  Decrease in captive audience: This means the target audience size may have remained the same as no new audience groups are adopting the platform as against the other platforms.

• Organic search may be the most preferred use case for the platform rather than paid search.

• Personal bias: People generally hate it when you put your products in their face in the form of ads and this is something that is common with platforms like Facebook & Google.
15/05/2021, 23:31 - +234 803 420 2314: Now, this is someone talking form a Digital Marketing perspective.

People hate interruption marketing which is archetypical of Facebook and Google
15/05/2021, 23:36 - +234 803 420 2314: To buttress the 'Organic Search' a lil further, relevant keywords needs to be used else your ads won't even be indexed by the SERP's. So many people feel the best way to go about advertising is straight to SEM; not always the case tho.
15/05/2021, 23:36 - +234 703 160 7868: Big big oyinbo...😅😅😅

15/05/2021, 23:38 - +234 803 420 2314: People only understand grammar which in most cases, they don't understand. At least it will  fill an A4, that's what they prefer.

15/05/2021, 23:46 - Richie: just to add sha... does spending more means the expected result is achieved? if you ask me, it is only showing us comparison between the listed names in relation to spending in advertising over 3 years..we don't know if the organisation using all this platform have same target audience thats why they are spending more on some..... product differs and target audience differ....if all organisation have similar target audience and we are presented this chart in that context then we can know its revealing a fact that organisation with same target audience are spending more on this platform...but we still cant use this insight for decision making. *in a nutshell we deserve to know where the data is coming from to do data validation*
15/05/2021, 23:52 - +234 803 420 2314: @2349058285150 I feel for them to have gotten to this visualization stage, the digital marketers already segmented their audiences and also known the key metrics they require for the analysis.
15/05/2021, 23:54 - +234 803 420 2314: Of course, they would have performed A/B Tests to determine which ad would scale and proceed further.
15/05/2021, 23:57 - Richie: well said but that isn't an insight we can take to the bank...since the question is *what can you read the chart and story* yes we can and alot of us said it...i was just saying it shows us nothing more than comparison based on spending all other things need validation else we can assume till the real owners tell us the data source...no be me plot am..😂
15/05/2021, 23:58 - +234 803 420 2314: I concur tho'
16/05/2021, 00:05 - +234 703 160 7868: You're absolutely correct. Further context needs to brought into the picture looking at the data generated across all mentioned platforms.

What I'll like to believe even though its an assumption is that the organizations/individuals that provided this data most likely use all the platforms as a medium for advertising and the information on the chart over the 3 year span likely shows how their preferences have changed with time albeit no substantial information was included here for us to understand why.

17/05/2021, 09:20 - +234 816 062 6971: Very annoying 
I remember when I was learning Hadoop and all those Apaches. Plus using some big data tools like Talend. I was not really enjoying it then. I don’t know of now sha. I was still a fresher then.

17/05/2021, 09:20 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: E rough

Over plenty😂😂


It's good sha just that the demand is unequal compared to the supply.
17/05/2021, 09:23 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Many organizations actually need more Data Engineers and Data Governance folks to put stuffs in place for the Data analyst and Data scientist to thrive
17/05/2021, 09:24 - David Adeyemo: Succinct!
17/05/2021, 09:28 - +234 816 062 6971: Talend suffer me then.
Before I solve a problem then.
I was finding it difficult to find exact solution. I needed to use my intuition lot of times. The community ehn.
And plus I was supposed to take courses on DB first.
I was using MongoDB, Cassandra, PostGres queries and some Network stuffs like FTPs on Talend without having thorough understanding of DBs, errors everywhere. I had to calm down by learning them in a structured way.
17/05/2021, 09:29 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: <Media omitted>
17/05/2021, 09:30 - +234 816 062 6971: I actually learnt Hadoop in a structured way but I didn’t just enjoy it then. Maybe because I just started my data journey sha.
17/05/2021, 09:32 - +234 816 062 6971: Exactly was I was doing then
I was envying the Data Scientists using the output of my cleaned and and easily accessible data 😭😂
17/05/2021, 09:32 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: That's true sef you were doing DE for Seamfix that time

17/05/2021, 13:02 - +234 817 925 1327: Hello Elders,

Hope we have all good?
I am working on a trucking rate prediction problem. I have built a baseline model using the truck size, product transported and distance for the prediction. I will like to include the truck's request date in the modeling but don't know how to handle this feature. can you help out on this?

Also, I want the model to be smart to recognize when there is inflation and it adjusts the price. So I thought of populating the data with monthly inflation rate. 

NB: I googled the inflation rate to add. what are the implications of doing so?
17/05/2021, 13:04 - Muhammed: Guys please who's got info about *E-Conext*? Can't seem to find sufficient information about them online.

17/05/2021, 21:26 - Muhammed: Quick tip, the service of guys who could analyze data is always needed on camp (till the last time I know of). Get your HDD, Flash drive and relevant stuffs ready.

Prepare to leave for camp a day before official opening (there'll be less search at the gates then). Wait a couple of days before the announcement is made, join the team of data analysts, try and secure the lead role. NYSC will provide you guys with a laptop. Boom, you can start working on your personal gigs with the laptop (on a coded level though).

This is a summary of my experience back in camp

21/05/2021, 21:10 - +234 818 368 5814: What’s the benefit of data warehouse to a data analyst?
21/05/2021, 21:12 - +234 708 531 6273: You have different transactional tables in a single database. It improves accessibility.
21/05/2021, 21:12 - +234 816 062 6971: KpK
Boss @2347085316273 is typing already
He will give a very good response
21/05/2021, 21:14 - +234 708 531 6273: Plus it is optimized for querying and analytics.

Your transactional tables are optimized for read and write only. They are not good for analytics
21/05/2021, 21:14 - +234 708 531 6273: Lol
21/05/2021, 21:18 - +234 818 368 5814: So an organization needs to have it to ease the stress of data analysts or Do I as a data analysts have to build data warehouse myself?
21/05/2021, 21:19 - +234 803 420 2314: Hmmmm! Let's get the answer from the top bosses; goid question
21/05/2021, 21:20 - +234 803 420 2314: I am guessing the DBAdmins and the DE would work on it
21/05/2021, 21:20 - +234 818 368 5814: 😁😁😁
21/05/2021, 21:20 - +234 818 368 5814: Then what are the processes involved in building one ?
21/05/2021, 21:22 - +234 803 420 2314: Data Entry personnel ==> Data Engineer ==> DB Admin ==> Data Analyst 

I hope my hierachy is correct though
21/05/2021, 21:22 - +234 818 368 5814: Once I grab this Data warehouse thing + everything wey I don know, Elon Musk suppose dey run after me ni
21/05/2021, 21:23 - +234 818 368 5814: Where DS now falls ?
21/05/2021, 21:23 - +234 803 420 2314: After the DA
21/05/2021, 21:27 - +234 816 062 6971: In my own opinion, I will say yes.
Because a data warehouse is not a solution for now only. Even if you leave the firm, it will be very useful to any other data analyst or data scientist that will join. 

You will probably not build only one model, you will make things easier for yourself moving forward. Stress your self to build it and create pipelines and then easily access those data points when next you want to build new models or use the data for other purposes.

I might be wrong
21/05/2021, 21:28 - Fabiyi Opeyemi: Not everyone have big brain like Abisiga to stess
21/05/2021, 21:33 - +234 708 531 6273: That is the work of a data engineer.  If you company doesn't have one you will have to build it yourself. 

If you do your analytics off of the transactional databases, it will be slowing down business operations. 

All you need is a replication tool like Attunity to copy data BTW databases in real time
21/05/2021, 21:34 - +234 816 062 6971: Me that don’t even know what I am saying 😂
I might be wrong.
21/05/2021, 21:35 - +234 816 062 6971: 🙌🏾
Or Talend
21/05/2021, 21:37 - +234 708 531 6273: You are not entering the data yourself.  It lives in a database already. 

You just have to move it to another dB optimized for analytics. 

You use a tool like attunity to do the replication and veridata to confirm that the data in your Warehouse is the same as that in your transactional db
21/05/2021, 21:37 - +234 708 531 6273: Exactly
21/05/2021, 21:38 - +234 816 062 6971: 👏👏👏
21/05/2021, 21:39 - +234 818 368 5814: Heard running queries directly on a live server slows down operations
21/05/2021, 21:40 - +234 818 368 5814: What’s the process for building and what expertise level is required.

Also what db privilege do you need to have ?
21/05/2021, 21:41 - +234 803 420 2314: 🗒️✒️ Attunity, Talend... okay o
21/05/2021, 21:41 - +234 708 531 6273: Well. Your db has to be on a live server to be accessible. Maybe by live server you mean transactional database.

If so, yes it will be. That is  y u need a warehouse 

More
21/05/2021, 21:42 - +234 803 420 2314: Full privilege
21/05/2021, 21:42 - +234 818 368 5814: Yes .. I mean transactional database
21/05/2021, 21:42 - +234 818 368 5814: Do DA usually have that privilege?
21/05/2021, 21:43 - +234 816 062 6971: You will be given
I was given when I was working as a DE
21/05/2021, 21:43 - +234 708 531 6273: Basic - intermediate database knowledge. 

You are just replicating tables . Dassol. After building the data warehouse, you can work with the DBAs to help administer accesses
21/05/2021, 21:44 - +234 818 368 5814: Data Entry ?
21/05/2021, 21:44 - +234 816 062 6971: Exactly 
I was working with the DBAs
21/05/2021, 21:44 - +234 816 062 6971: Nope
Data Engineer
21/05/2021, 21:44 - +234 818 368 5814: Okay...
21/05/2021, 21:44 - +234 803 420 2314: Nope
21/05/2021, 21:45 - +234 818 368 5814: Will be access now be given to a DA ?
21/05/2021, 21:45 - +234 816 062 6971: 🤔🤔🤔
Your line manager or boss should help request access
21/05/2021, 21:47 - +234 816 062 6971: I was also a DA then
I started as a DA
21/05/2021, 21:48 - +234 818 368 5814: So far:
Data warehouse is copies of the original transactional db.

 You need full db privilege before you can do it.

You need both basic and intermediate db knowledge before you can build one. 

You make use of tools like Talend, Attunity to create a data warehouse.
21/05/2021, 21:48 - +234 818 368 5814: Also, where’s is ETL coming in ?
21/05/2021, 21:50 - +234 816 062 6971: Using the attunity or Talend
21/05/2021, 21:50 - +234 816 062 6971: It is part of the pipeline you will create
21/05/2021, 21:50 - +234 803 420 2314: @2348179651769 is having a masterclass tomorrow regarding ETL, send him a DM for the link
21/05/2021, 21:53 - +234 708 531 6273: ELT this time around .
You extract and load into another dB. 

From the DW  you can then do any transformation you want
21/05/2021, 21:54 - +234 816 062 6971: I have forgotten why ELT instead of ETL 😬
21/05/2021, 21:56 - +234 816 062 6971: Yeah, I just remembered 
You load it first into a faster DB and then all sought of transformations
21/05/2021, 21:56 - +234 818 368 5814: Omo big word for simple process 😂 

So ELT is the process of moving tables from transactional database to your DW database
21/05/2021, 21:56 - +234 708 531 6273: That is just the most efficient approach.  Don't forget you are moving heavy dbs.  If you try to do transformation along the way, you are complicating things
21/05/2021, 21:57 - +234 708 531 6273: More like it.
21/05/2021, 21:57 - +234 708 531 6273: Yes. As it were
21/05/2021, 21:58 - +234 816 062 6971: Yes boss, that’s true. I remember 
I had to explain it in one of the articles I wrote on ETL then
21/05/2021, 22:00 - +234 818 368 5814: Can you share ?
21/05/2021, 22:01 - +234 902 044 0447: Pointless
But Jack ma has a better argument
21/05/2021, 22:09 - +234 818 368 5814: One more thing.

What’s the risk with DW 

😂 😂
21/05/2021, 22:13 - +234 816 062 6971: We used to write articles after completing a project at that firm, I left before it was published. Although, it had already been vetted before I left. I can’t even trace it or remember the title. 
Chai 🤦🏾😢
I think I talked about 10 different tools, their prons and cons, the challenges I faced using Talend. All what I did with Talend, explained why ETL is needed, difference between ETL and ELT. ETL tool vs code based ETL, and many other things
21/05/2021, 22:16 - +234 816 062 6971: I think I will direct it to the boss
@2347085316273 
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

I can’t remember recollect, it’s been a long time.

22/05/2021, 09:22 - +234 708 531 6273: Latency - Sometimes,  the data in the DW will be behind by minutes to hours. The reason why this happens can't really be explained as the replication catches up later.

Apart from that there is no risk specific to a DW that doesn't happen to others
22/05/2021, 10:06 - +234 818 368 5814: 🤝🤝🤝

I'm kinda terrible at writing and/or speaking it self. I'd rather communicate in English, Hausa or Arabic (not so fluent in these two languages though ☹️), than Yorùbá itself.

When all these have been completed, install the power bi again and let's see if your issue will be solved.
