Microsoft's Power BI course on edX was the first course I took on Power BI and is a good place to start for those looking to start exploring the Power BI software.  https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-power-bi-7  The next course I took was the Intermediate course at BI Elite Training. There's currently 3 courses offered on this platform; a beginner course, an intermediate course and a course for those preparing for the DA-100 Power BI certification exam. There's a 1 week free trial going on and you can take advantage of this platform and access any of these courses. If you have no experience with Power BI, I'll advise you start with the beginner course. For those looking to enhance their skills, you can check out the intermediate course.  https://training.bielite.com/courses/  Here are some amazing YouTube channels where you'll find some of the best Power BI content:  Guy in a Cube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFp1vaKzpfvoGai0vE5VJ0w  BI Elite: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-h-wArcxJC8zBOD-UxfCOg    Thanks to @2348108522573 for suggesting this as I'm sure it'll help those looking to improve on their BI skills."
